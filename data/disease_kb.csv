AIDS,,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease.","HIV/AIDS is a terminal illness, as there is currently no cure, nor an effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), which slows progression of the disease. As of 2022, 39 million people globally were living with HIV, and 29.8 million people were accessing ART. Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections. As of July 2022, four people have been successfully cleared of HIV. Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy within one week of diagnosis appear to improve treatment outcomes in low and medium-income settings and is recommend for newly diagnosed HIV patients. HIV retinopathy was a very common cause of blindness in people with AIDS before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, but its incidence is declining due to proper and timely management of AIDS. Even if there are signs of retinopathy, it may reverse as CD4+ T cell counts increase. Reversal of HIV retinopathy is a helpful sign of positive response to antiretroviral therapy in AIDS patients. But if HIV treatment is delayed it may lead to permanent visual loss.

Retrieved 10 October 2025., the English physician Sir Thomas Willis, one of the founders of the Royal Society first described the condition now known as achalasia and treated the problem with a dilation using a sea sponge attached to a whale bone. In 1881, the German Polish-Austrian physician Johann Freiherr von Mikulicz-Radecki described the disease as cardiospasm, and felt it was a functional problem rather than a mechanical one. In 1913, Ernest Heller became the first person to successfully perform an esophagomyotomy, now known in his namesake as the Heller myotomy. In 1929, two physicians – Hurst and Rake – figured out that the problem was due to the LES not relaxing. They named the disease achalasia, meaning inability to relax. In 1937, the physician F.C. Lendram affirmed the conclusions of Hurst and Rake in 1929, forwarding the usage of the term achalasia over cardiospasm. In 1955, the German physician Rudolph Nissen, a student of Ferdinand Sauerbruch, performed the first fundoplomy, now known in his namesake as the Nissen fundoplication, eventually publishing the results of two cases in a 1956 copy of Swiss Medical Weekly. In 1962, the physician Dor reported the first anterior partial fundoplication, acting as a solution to the intense post-surgery GERD and risk of stomach acid inhalation accompanying Heller myotomy. In 1963, the physician Toupet reported the first posterior partial fundoplication. In 1991, the physician Shimi and his colleagues performed the first laparoscopic Heller myotomy in England.

These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide (niacinamide), retinoids, and salicylic acid. Acne treatments work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing C. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Typical treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies, including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids. Recommended therapies for first-line use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics.

Alcohol Use Disorder,"Cravings for alcohol, inability to control or limit alcohol consumption, withdrawal symptoms (such as tremors, anxiety, sweating) when attempting to stop or reduce alcohol use, continued use despite negative consequences (such as relationship problems, health issues), neglecting responsibilities, tolerance to alcohol",Alcoholism is the continued drinking of alcohol despite it causing problems. Some definitions require evidence of dependence and withdrawal. Problematic alcohol use has been mentioned in the earliest historical records.,"The World Health Organization, the European Union and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism. Increasing the age at which alcohol can be purchased, and banning or restricting alcohol beverage advertising are common methods to reduce alcohol use among adolescents and young adults in particular, see Alcoholism in adolescence. Another common method of alcoholism prevention is taxation of alcohol products – increasing price of alcohol by 10% is linked with reduction of consumption of up to 10%. Credible, evidence-based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol misuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol misuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested. Because alcohol is often used for self-medication of conditions like anxiety temporarily, prevention of alcoholism may be attempted by reducing the severity or prevalence of stress and anxiety in individuals. Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. Much of the treatment community for alcoholism supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach popularized by the 12 step program of Alcoholics Anonymous; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.","['cravings for alcohol', 'inability to control or limit alcohol consumption', 'withdrawal symptoms (such as tremors', 'anxiety', 'sweating) when attempting to stop or reduce alcohol use', 'continued use despite negative consequences (such as relationship problems', 'health issues)', 'neglecting responsibilities', 'tolerance to alcohol']","alcohol use disorder cravings for alcohol, inability to control or limit alcohol consumption, withdrawal symptoms (such as tremors, anxiety, sweating) when attempting to stop or reduce alcohol use, continued use despite negative consequences (such as relationship problems, health issues), neglecting responsibilities, tolerance to alcohol alcoholism is the continued drinking of alcohol despite it causing problems. some definitions require evidence of dependence and withdrawal. problematic alcohol use has been mentioned in the earliest historical records. the world health organization, the european union and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism. increasing the age at which alcohol can be purchased, and banning or restricting alcohol beverage advertising are common methods to reduce alcohol use among adolescents and young adults in particular, see alcoholism in adolescence. another common method of alcoholism prevention is taxation of alcohol products increasing price of alcohol by 10 is linked with reduction of consumption of up to 10 . credible, evidence-based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol misuse have been recommended. guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol misuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested. because alcohol is often used for self-medication of conditions like anxiety temporarily, prevention of alcoholism may be attempted by reducing the severity or prevalence of stress and anxiety in individuals. treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. an example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. much of the treatment community for alcoholism supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach popularized by the 12 step program of alcoholics anonymous however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach."

There is some evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful, and that early exposure to potential allergens may actually be protective. According to recent studies from pediatric professionals in the U.K. and North Carolina, they suggest that early exposure to peanut products has greatly reduced peanut allergies among young children in the U.S. Following milestone research from a decade ago, the studies found that pediatric guidelines from 2015 and 2017 were revised to encourage introducing peanuts to high risk infants from the early ages of 4 to 6 months. Researchers who looked into the collected data found a 43% drop in the frequent occurrence of peanut allergies. Which prevented an estimated 40,000 cases and resulted in a noticeable decline in overall food allergy cases. While this is notable, some pediatric experts want to ensure that caution is still provided to the public about the real-world implementation of guidelines since there are potential inconsistencies and limitations. These findings focus on the benefits and risks of early allergen introductions to hopefully slow the rise of food allergies.

Amyloidosis,"Fatigue, weight loss, organ dysfunction","Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins, known as amyloid fibrils, build up in tissue. There are several non-specific and vague signs and symptoms associated with amyloidosis. These include fatigue, peripheral edema, weight loss, shortness of breath, palpitations, and feeling faint with standing.","Treatment depends on the type of amyloidosis that is present. Treatment with high dose melphalan, a chemotherapy agent, followed by stem cell transplantation has shown promise in early studies and is recommended for stage I and II AL amyloidosis. However, only 20–25% of people are eligible for stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy treatment including cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone-daratumumab (Dara-Cybord) is currently the recommended treatment option for people with AL Amyloidosis not eligible for transplant. In AA, symptoms may improve if the underlying condition is treated. In people who have inflammation caused by AA amyloidosis, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors such as infliximab and etanercept are used for an average duration of 20 months. If TNF-alpha inhibitors are not effective, Interleukin-1 inhibitors (e.g., anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) and interleukin-6 inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab) may be considered. Management of ATTR amyloidosis will depend on its classification as wild type or variant. Both may be treated with tafamidis, a low toxicity oral agent that prevents destabilization of correctly folded protein. Studies showed tafamidis reduced mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure. Previously, for variant ATTR amyloidosis, liver transplant was the only effective treatment. New therapies include diflunisal, inotersen, and patisiran. Diflunisal binds to misfolded mutant TTR protein to prevent its buildup, like how tafamidis works. Low-certainty evidence indicates that it mitigates worsening of peripheral neuropathy and disability from disease progression. Inotersen blocks gene expression of both wild-type and mutant TTR, reducing amyloid precursor. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that it mitigates worsening of peripheral neuropathy. Long-term efficacy and safety of inotersen use in people with mutant TTR-related amyloidosis is still be evaluated in a phase-III clinical trial as of 2021. Both diflunisal and inotersen may also mitigate declines in quality-of-life, though the evidence for this effect is unclear. For people with cardiac ATTR the effect of inotersen use is inconclusive and requires further investigation. In 2018, inotersen was approved by the European Medicines Agency to treat polyneuropathy in adults with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. It has since been approved for use in Canada, the European Union and in the USA. Patisiran functions similarly to inotersen. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that patisiran mitigates worsening of peripheral neuropathy and disability from disease progression. Additionally, low-certainty evidence suggests that patisiran mitigates decreases in quality-of-life and slightly reduces the rate of adverse events versus placebo. There is no evidence of an effect on mortality rate. A review of early data from use of patisiran in people with variant cardiac ATTR suggests that it may reduce mortality and hospitalization, however this is still being investigated and requires further investigation. In 2018, patisiran was not recommended by NICE in the UK for hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis. As of July 2019 further review however is occurring. It was approved for this use in the United States, however. The roles of inotersen and patisiran in cardiac ATTR amyloidosis are still being investigated.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),"Progressive muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing and speaking","Progressive muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing and speaking. Degeneration of motor nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.","There is no cure for ALS. Management focuses on treating symptoms and providing supportive care to improve quality of life and prolong survival. This care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals; attending a multidisciplinary ALS clinic is associated with longer survival, fewer hospitalizations, and improved quality of life. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the main treatment for respiratory failure in ALS. In people with normal bulbar function, it prolongs survival by about seven months and improves the quality of life. One study found that NIV is ineffective for people with poor bulbar function while another suggested that it may provide a modest survival benefit. Many people with ALS have difficulty tolerating NIV. Invasive ventilation is an option for people with advanced ALS when NIV is not enough to manage their symptoms. While invasive ventilation prolongs survival, disease progression, and functional decline continue. It may decrease the quality of life of people with ALS or their caregivers. Invasive ventilation is more commonly used in Japan than in North America or Europe. Physical therapy can promote functional independence through aerobic, range of motion, and stretching exercises. Occupational therapy can assist with activities of daily living through adaptive equipment. Speech therapy can assist people with ALS who have difficulty speaking. Preventing weight loss and malnutrition in people with ALS improves both survival and quality of life. Initially, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) can be managed by dietary changes and swallowing techniques. A feeding tube should be considered if someone with ALS loses 5% or more of their body weight or if they cannot safely swallow food and water.

Anxiety,"Excessive worrying, restlessness, increased heart rate, panic attacks",,"The first step in the management of a person with anxiety symptoms involves evaluating the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, the recognition of which is essential in order to decide the correct treatment. Anxiety symptoms may mask an organic disease, or appear associated with or as a result of a medical disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first line treatment. CBT appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet. While evidence for mental health apps is promising, it is preliminary. Anxiety often affects relationships, and interpersonal psychotherapy addresses these issues by improving communication and relationship skills. Psychopharmacological treatment can be used in parallel to CBT or can be used alone. As a general rule, most anxiety disorders respond well to first-line agents. Such drugs, also used as anti-depressants, are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, that work by blocking the reuptake of specific neurotransmitters and resulting in the increase in availability of these neurotransmitters. Additionally, benzodiazepines are often prescribed to individuals with anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines produce an anxiolytic response by modulating GABA and increasing its receptor binding. A third common treatment involves a category of drug known as serotonin agonists. This category of drug works by initiating a physiological response at 5-HT1A receptor by increasing the action of serotonin at this receptor. Other treatment options include pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, and moclobemide, among others. Anxiety is considered to be a serious psychiatric illness that has an unknown true pervasiveness due to affected individuals not asking for proper treatment or aid, and due to professionals missing the diagnosis. The above risk factors give natural avenues for prevention. Psychological or educational interventions have a small yet statistically significant benefit for the prevention of anxiety in varied population types.

Aplastic Anemia,"Fatigue, pale skin, frequent infections, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeats, prolonged bleeding or bruising","Aplastic anemia (AA) is a severe hematologic condition in which the body fails to make blood cells in sufficient numbers. Normally, blood cells are produced in the bone marrow by stem cells that reside there, but patients with aplastic anemia have a deficiency of all blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It occurs most frequently in people in their teens and twenties but is also common among the elderly.","Treating immune-mediated aplastic anemia involves suppression of the immune system, an effect achieved by daily medicine or, in more severe cases, a bone marrow transplant, a potential cure. The transplanted bone marrow replaces the failing bone marrow cells with new ones from a matching donor. The multipotent stem cells in the bone marrow reconstitute all three blood cell lines, giving the patient a new immune system, red blood cells, and platelets. However, besides the risk of graft failure, there is also a risk that the newly created white blood cells may attack the rest of the body (""graft-versus-host disease""). In young patients with an HLA-matched sibling donor, bone marrow transplant can be considered as a first-line treatment. Patients lacking a matched sibling donor typically pursue immunosuppression as a first-line treatment, and matched, unrelated donor transplants are considered second-line therapy. Treatment often includes a course of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and several months of treatment with ciclosporin to modulate the immune system. Chemotherapy with agents such as cyclophosphamide may also be effective but is more toxic than ATG. Antibody therapy such as ATG targets T cells, which are believed to attack the bone marrow. Corticosteroids are generally ineffective, though they are used to ameliorate serum sickness caused by ATG. Normally, success is judged by bone marrow biopsy six months after initial treatment with ATG. One prospective study involving cyclophosphamide was terminated early due to a high incidence of mortality from severe infections as a result of prolonged neutropenia. Before the above treatments became available, patients with low leukocyte counts were often confined to a sterile room or bubble (to reduce risk of infection), as in the case of Ted DeVita.","['fatigue', 'pale skin', 'frequent infections', 'shortness of breath', 'rapid or irregular heartbeats', 'prolonged bleeding or bruising']","aplastic anemia fatigue, pale skin, frequent infections, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeats, prolonged bleeding or bruising aplastic anemia (aa) is a severe hematologic condition in which the body fails to make blood cells in sufficient numbers. normally, blood cells are produced in the bone marrow by stem cells that reside there, but patients with aplastic anemia have a deficiency of all blood cell types red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. it occurs most frequently in people in their teens and twenties but is also common among the elderly. treating immune-mediated aplastic anemia involves suppression of the immune system, an effect achieved by daily medicine or, in more severe cases, a bone marrow transplant, a potential cure. the transplanted bone marrow replaces the failing bone marrow cells with new ones from a matching donor. the multipotent stem cells in the bone marrow reconstitute all three blood cell lines, giving the patient a new immune system, red blood cells, and platelets. however, besides the risk of graft failure, there is also a risk that the newly created white blood cells may attack the rest of the body ( graft-versus-host disease ). in young patients with an hla-matched sibling donor, bone marrow transplant can be considered as a first-line treatment. patients lacking a matched sibling donor typically pursue immunosuppression as a first-line treatment, and matched, unrelated donor transplants are considered second-line therapy. treatment often includes a course of antithymocyte globulin (atg) and several months of treatment with ciclosporin to modulate the immune system. chemotherapy with agents such as cyclophosphamide may also be effective but is more toxic than atg. antibody therapy such as atg targets t cells, which are believed to attack the bone marrow. corticosteroids are generally ineffective, though they are used to ameliorate serum sickness caused by atg. normally, success is judged by bone marrow biopsy six months after initial treatment with atg. one prospective study involving cyclophosphamide was terminated early due to a high incidence of mortality from severe infections as a result of prolonged neutropenia. before the above treatments became available, patients with low leukocyte counts were often confined to a sterile room or bubble (to reduce risk of infection), as in the case of ted devita."

Asthma,"Recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, especially at night or in response to triggers such as allergens or exercise","Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the bronchioles of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.","The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak. The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections. Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication. Early pet exposure may be useful. Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet. Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breastfeeding are not effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended. Omega-3 consumption, Mediterranean diet and antioxidants have been suggested by some studies to potentially help prevent crises, but the evidence is still inconclusive. Reducing or eliminating compounds known to provoke sensitive people from the workplace may be effective. It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affect the risk of exacerbations. Immunization, however, is recommended by the World Health Organization. Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma. While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved. The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, use of electronic cigarettes, pets or other allergens, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories. The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms; however, real world use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated. People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called ""refractory"" asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called ""difficult to treat"" asthma). In practice, it is not possible to distinguish ""refractory"" from ""difficult to treat"" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications. A related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma. For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking diminishes the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management. Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments. People with asthma have higher rates of anxiety, psychological stress, and depression. This is associated with poorer asthma control. Cognitive behavioural therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma. Improving people's knowledge about asthma and using a written action plan has been identified as an important component of managing asthma. Providing educational sessions that include information specific to a person's culture is likely effective. More research is necessary to determine if increasing preparedness and knowledge of asthma among school staff and families using home-based and school interventions results in long-term improvements in safety for children with asthma. School-based asthma self-management interventions, which attempt to improve knowledge of asthma, its triggers, and the importance of regular practitioner review, may reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits.

Astigmatism,"Blurred or distorted vision, eye strain, headaches,uneven curvature of cornea","Astigmatism is a type of refractive error due to rotational asymmetry in the eye's refractive power. The lens and cornea of an eye without astigmatism are nearly spherical, with only a single radius of curvature, and any refractive errors present can be corrected with simple glasses. In an eye with astigmatism, either the lens or the cornea is slightly egg-shaped, with higher curvature in one direction than the other.","Astigmatism may be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery (including laser surgery). Glasses are the simplest and safest, although contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision. Refractive surgery can eliminate the need to wear corrective lenses altogether by permanently changing the shape of the eye but, like all elective surgery, comes with both greater risk and expense than the non-invasive options. Various considerations involving eye health, refractive status, and lifestyle determine whether one option may be better than another. In those with keratoconus, certain contact lenses often enable patients to achieve better visual acuity than eyeglasses. Once only available in a rigid, gas-permeable form, toric lenses are now also available as soft lenses. In older people, astigmatism can also be corrected during cataract surgery. This can either be done by inserting a toric intraocular lens or by performing special incisions (limbal relaxing incisions). Toric intraocular lenses probably provide a better outcome with respect to astigmatism in these cases than limbal relaxing incisions. Toric intraocular lenses can additionally be used in patients with complex ophthalmic history, such as previous ophthalmic surgery. In such complex cases, toric intraocular lenses seem to be as effective as in non-complex cases for correction of concurrent corneal astigmatism. With advancement in laser science and the increasingly prevalent use of surgical laser systems in ophthalmology, laser eye surgery has become one of the most commonly used methods for treating astigmatism, with success rates among the highest of all the currently available treatment methods according to peer-reviewed research studies and comparative analyses.","['blurred or distorted vision', 'eye strain', 'headaches', 'uneven curvature of cornea']","astigmatism blurred or distorted vision, eye strain, headaches,uneven curvature of cornea astigmatism is a type of refractive error due to rotational asymmetry in the eye s refractive power. the lens and cornea of an eye without astigmatism are nearly spherical, with only a single radius of curvature, and any refractive errors present can be corrected with simple glasses. in an eye with astigmatism, either the lens or the cornea is slightly egg-shaped, with higher curvature in one direction than the other. astigmatism may be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery (including laser surgery). glasses are the simplest and safest, although contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision. refractive surgery can eliminate the need to wear corrective lenses altogether by permanently changing the shape of the eye but, like all elective surgery, comes with both greater risk and expense than the non-invasive options. various considerations involving eye health, refractive status, and lifestyle determine whether one option may be better than another. in those with keratoconus, certain contact lenses often enable patients to achieve better visual acuity than eyeglasses. once only available in a rigid, gas-permeable form, toric lenses are now also available as soft lenses. in older people, astigmatism can also be corrected during cataract surgery. this can either be done by inserting a toric intraocular lens or by performing special incisions (limbal relaxing incisions). toric intraocular lenses probably provide a better outcome with respect to astigmatism in these cases than limbal relaxing incisions. toric intraocular lenses can additionally be used in patients with complex ophthalmic history, such as previous ophthalmic surgery. in such complex cases, toric intraocular lenses seem to be as effective as in non-complex cases for correction of concurrent corneal astigmatism. with advancement in laser science and the increasingly prevalent use of surgical laser systems in ophthalmology, laser eye surgery has become one of the most commonly used methods for treating astigmatism, with success rates among the highest of all the currently available treatment methods according to peer-reviewed research studies and comparative analyses."

Atelectasis,"Difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, chest pain","Atelectasis is the partial collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absence in gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume, as distinct from pulmonary consolidation, in which they are filled with liquid.","Treatment is directed at correcting the underlying cause. In atelectasis manifestations that result from the mucus plugging of the airways as seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and pneumonia, mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine (NAC) is used. This nebulized treatment works by reducing mucous viscosity and elasticity by breaking disulfide bonds in mucoproteins within the mucus complex, thus facilitating mucus clearance. Post-surgical atelectasis is treated by physiotherapy, focusing on deep breathing and encouraging coughing. An incentive spirometer is often used as part of the breathing exercises. Walking is also highly encouraged to improve lung inflation. People with chest deformities or neurologic conditions that cause shallow breathing for long periods may benefit from mechanical devices that assist their breathing. The primary treatment for acute massive atelectasis is correction of the underlying cause. A blockage that cannot be removed by coughing or by suctioning the airways often can be removed by bronchoscopy. Antibiotics are given for an infection. Chronic atelectasis is often treated with antibiotics because infection is almost inevitable. In certain cases, the affected part of the lung may be surgically removed when recurring or chronic infections become disabling or bleeding is significant.

Medical management of atherosclerosis first involves modification to risk factors–for example, via smoking cessation and diet restrictions. Prevention is generally achieved by eating a healthy diet, exercising, maintaining a normal weight, and not smoking. Treatment of established disease may include medications to lower cholesterol, such as statins, blood pressure medication, or medications that decrease clotting, such as aspirin. Many procedures may also be carried out such as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or carotid endarterectomy. Medical treatments often focus on alleviating symptoms.

Atrial Fibrillation,"Irregular or rapid heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort, dizziness or lightheadedness, fatigue","Atrial fibrillation (AF, AFib or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. It often begins as short periods of abnormal beating, which become longer or continuous over time. It may also start as other forms of arrhythmia such as atrial flutter that then transform into AF. Episodes can be asymptomatic.","Prevention of atrial fibrillation focuses primarily on preventing or controlling its risk factors. Many of its risk factors, such as obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption, are modifiable and preventable with lifestyle modification or can be managed by a healthcare professional. The main goals of treatment are to prevent circulatory instability and stroke. Rate or rhythm control is used to achieve the former, whereas anticoagulation is used to decrease the risk of the latter. If cardiovascularly unstable due to uncontrolled tachycardia, immediate cardioversion is indicated. Many antiarrhythmics, when used long term, increase the risk of death without any meaningful benefit. An integrated management approach, which includes stroke prevention, symptoms control and management of associated comorbidities has been associated with better outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation. This holistic or integrated care approach is summed up as the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway, as follows: A: Avoid stroke with Anticoagulation, where the default is stroke prevention unless the patient is at low risk. Stroke prevention means use of oral anticoagulation (OAC), whether with well managed vitamin K antagonists (VKA), with time in therapeutic range >70%, or more commonly, label-adherent dosed direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC).

Atrophic vaginitis,"Vaginal dryness, Vaginal burning, frequent urination, urinary tract infections, Painful intercourse","Atrophic vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina as a result of tissue thinning due to low estrogen levels. Symptoms may include pain during penetrative sex, vaginal itchiness or dryness, and an urge to urinate or burning with urination. It generally does not resolve without ongoing treatment.","Symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) will unlikely be resolved without treatment. Some individuals may have many or a few symptoms so treatment is provided that best suits each person. If other health problems are also present, these can be taken into account when determining the best course of treatment. For those who have symptoms related to sexual activities, a lubricant may be sufficient. If both urinary and genital symptoms exist, local, low-dose estrogen therapy can be effective. Those individuals who are survivors of hormone-sensitive cancer may need to be treated more cautiously. Some people can have symptoms that are widespread and may be at risk for osteoporosis. Estrogen and adjuvants may be best. Recent research showed a medication called ospemifene can be an alternative oral treatment if vaginal products or hormone therapy is not suitable for patients surviving gynecological cancer. Ospemifene can increase collagen production to improve vaginal tissue, which will help reduce GSM symptoms. Studies have shown this medication has helped increase vaginal pH, elasticity, and moisture to improve vaginal health as well as sexual and emotional well-being. Topical treatment with estrogen is effective when the symptoms are severe and relieves the disruption in pH to restore the microbiome of the vagina. When symptoms include those related to the urinary system, systematic treatment can be used. Recommendations for the use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration help to prevent adverse endometrial effects. Treatment is generally with estrogen cream applied to the vagina. The use of estrogen for treatment do come at some risk. Those who are treated with estrogen may be at a higher risk of developing vaginal candidiasis since estrogen allows lactobacilli to increase in levels. Additionally, it is recommended that soaps and other irritants are avoided. Some treatments have been developed more recently. These include selective estrogen receptor modulators, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone, and laser therapy. Other treatments are available without a prescription such as vaginal lubricants and moisturizers. Vaginal dilators may be helpful. Since GSM may also cause urinary problems related to pelvic floor dysfunction, the person may benefit from pelvic floor strengthening exercises. The individual and their partners have reported that estrogen therapy resulted in less painful sex, more satisfaction with sex, and an improvement in their sex life. If a person cannot tolerate or use estrogen therapy, topical hyaluronic acid can be used as another option which has been shown to be safe and effective.

Autism,"Challenges with social interaction, communication difficulties, restricted interests or repetitive behaviors",,"Currently, there is no cure for autism. From the perspective of neurodiversity, ""curing"" or otherwise treating autism may not be an appropriate goal. Interventions targeting specific challenges or co-occurring conditions associated with autism are widely regarded as important. Perspectives on the goals of these interventions vary: the medical model of disability often focuses on addressing core characteristics such as social communication difficulties and restricted/repetitive behaviors. The neurodiversity movement supports interventions aimed at enhancing functional communication (spoken or non-spoken), managing related issues like anxiety or inertia, or addressing behaviors considered harmful, rather than seeking to alter core autistic features. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy, but the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced. Several therapies can help autistic children, and they are typically tailored to the child's needs. The main goals of therapy are to lessen associated difficulties and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs correlate with higher responsiveness to interventions and larger intervention outcomes. Behavioral, psychological, educational, and skill-building interventions may be used to help autistic people learn skills for living independently, as well as other social, communication, and language skills. Therapy also aims to reduce behaviors perceived as inappropriate and to build upon strengths.

Bronchial Asthma,,"Bronchial asthma is a medical condition which causes the airway path of the lungs to swell and narrow. Due to this swelling, the air path produces excess mucus making it hard to breathe, which results in coughing, short breath, and wheezing. The disease is chronic and interferes with daily working.","The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak. The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections. Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication. Early pet exposure may be useful. Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet. Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breastfeeding are not effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended. Omega-3 consumption, Mediterranean diet and antioxidants have been suggested by some studies to potentially help prevent crises, but the evidence is still inconclusive. Reducing or eliminating compounds known to provoke sensitive people from the workplace may be effective. It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affect the risk of exacerbations. Immunization, however, is recommended by the World Health Organization. Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma. While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved. The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, use of electronic cigarettes, pets or other allergens, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories. The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms; however, real world use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated. People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called ""refractory"" asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called ""difficult to treat"" asthma). In practice, it is not possible to distinguish ""refractory"" from ""difficult to treat"" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications. A related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma. For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking diminishes the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management. Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended.

However, there is no evidence regarding the use in these instances.",[],"bronchial asthma bronchial asthma is a medical condition which causes the airway path of the lungs to swell and narrow. due to this swelling, the air path produces excess mucus making it hard to breathe, which results in coughing, short breath, and wheezing. the disease is chronic and interferes with daily working. the evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak. the world health organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections. other efforts that show promise include limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication. early pet exposure may be useful. results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet. dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breastfeeding are not effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended. omega-3 consumption, mediterranean diet and antioxidants have been suggested by some studies to potentially help prevent crises, but the evidence is still inconclusive. reducing or eliminating compounds known to provoke sensitive people from the workplace may be effective. it is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affect the risk of exacerbations. immunization, however, is recommended by the world health organization. smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma. while there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved. the most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, use of electronic cigarettes, pets or other allergens, and eliminating exposure to them. if trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories. the medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms however, real world use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated. people with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called refractory asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called difficult to treat asthma). in practice, it is not possible to distinguish refractory from difficult to treat categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications. a related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma. for example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking diminishes the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management. bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. in those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. if mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"Tingling, numbness, and pain in the hand and fingers","Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a nerve compression syndrome caused when the median nerve, in the carpal tunnel of the wrist, becomes compressed. CTS can affect both wrists when it is known as bilateral CTS. After a wrist fracture, inflammation and bone displacement can compress the median nerve. With rheumatoid arthritis, the enlarged synovial lining of the tendons causes compression.","There is little or no data to support the concept that activity adjustment prevents carpal tunnel syndrome. The evidence for using a wrist rest at a computer keyboard is debated. There is also little research supporting that ergonomics is related to carpal tunnel syndrome. Given that biological factors, such as genetic predisposition and anthropometric features, are more strongly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome than occupational/environmental factors such as hand use, CTS may not be prevented by activity modifications. Some claim that worksite modifications such as switching from a QWERTY computer keyboard layout to Dvorak are helpful, but meta-analyses of the available studies note limited supported evidence. There are more than 50 types of treatments for CTS with varied levels of evidence and recommendations across healthcare guidelines, with evidence most strongly supporting surgery, steroids, splinting for wrist positioning, and physical or occupational therapy interventions. When selecting treatment, it is important to consider the severity and chronicity of the CTS pathophysiology and to distinguish treatments that can alter the natural history of the pathophysiology (disease-modifying treatments) and treatments that only alleviate symptoms (palliative treatments). The strongest evidence for disease-modifying treatment in chronic or severe CTS cases is carpal tunnel surgery to change the shape of the carpal tunnel. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends proceeding conservatively with a course of nonsurgical therapies tried before release surgery is considered. A different treatment should be tried if the current treatment fails to resolve the symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Early surgery with carpal tunnel release is indicated where there is evidence of median nerve denervation or a person elects to proceed directly to surgical treatment. Recommendations may differ when carpal tunnel syndrome is found in association with the following conditions: diabetes mellitus, coexistent cervical radiculopathy, hypothyroidism, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome in the workplace. CTS related to another pathophysiology is addressed by treating that pathology. For instance, disease-modifying medications for rheumatoid arthritis or surgery for traumatic acute carpal tunnel syndrome.

This includes avoiding competitive sports, very strenuous exercise and highly stressful environments, as high levels of adrenaline can occur in these settings, which can provoke arrhythmias.","['fainting due to exercise/stress', 'palpitations']","catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia fainting due to exercise/stress, palpitations fainting due to exercise/stress, palpitations. genetic heart rhythm disorders. treatments for cpvt aim to prevent lethal abnormal heart rhythms from occurring, and to rapidly restore a normal rhythm if they do occur. as the arrhythmias in cpvt generally occur at times when the heart is exposed to high levels of adrenaline or other similar chemical messengers (catecholamines), many treatments for cpvt aim to lower the levels of catecholamines the heart is exposed to or block their effects on the heart. the first-line treatment for those with cpvt involves lifestyle advice. this includes avoiding competitive sports, very strenuous exercise and highly stressful environments, as high levels of adrenaline can occur in these settings, which can provoke arrhythmias."
Cellulitis,"Redness, Pain, tenderness, Swelling, Skin changes, Lymph node enlargement",Cellulitis is usually a bacterial infection involving the inner layers of the skin. It specifically affects the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Signs and symptoms include an area of redness which increases in size over a few days.,"In those who have previously had cellulitis, the use of antibiotics may help prevent future episodes. This is recommended by Clinical Resource Efficiency Support Team (CREST) for those who have had more than two episodes. A 2017 meta-analysis found a benefit of preventative antibiotics for recurrent cellulitis in the lower limbs, but the preventative effects appear to diminish after stopping antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics are usually prescribed, with the agent selected based on suspected organism and presence or absence of purulence, although the best treatment choice is unclear. If an abscess is also present, surgical drainage is usually indicated, with antibiotics often prescribed for co-existent cellulitis, especially if extensive. Pain relief is also often prescribed, but excessive pain should always be investigated, as it is a symptom of necrotizing fasciitis. Elevation of the affected area is often recommended. Steroids may speed recovery in those on antibiotics.","['redness', 'pain', 'tenderness', 'swelling', 'skin changes', 'lymph node enlargement']","cellulitis redness, pain, tenderness, swelling, skin changes, lymph node enlargement cellulitis is usually a bacterial infection involving the inner layers of the skin. it specifically affects the dermis and subcutaneous fat. signs and symptoms include an area of redness which increases in size over a few days. in those who have previously had cellulitis, the use of antibiotics may help prevent future episodes. this is recommended by clinical resource efficiency support team (crest) for those who have had more than two episodes. a 2017 meta-analysis found a benefit of preventative antibiotics for recurrent cellulitis in the lower limbs, but the preventative effects appear to diminish after stopping antibiotic therapy. antibiotics are usually prescribed, with the agent selected based on suspected organism and presence or absence of purulence, although the best treatment choice is unclear. if an abscess is also present, surgical drainage is usually indicated, with antibiotics often prescribed for co-existent cellulitis, especially if extensive. pain relief is also often prescribed, but excessive pain should always be investigated, as it is a symptom of necrotizing fasciitis. elevation of the affected area is often recommended. steroids may speed recovery in those on antibiotics."
Cerebral Palsy,,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of movement disorders that appear in early childhood. Signs and symptoms vary among people and over time, but include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors. There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, and speech.","Because the causes of CP are varied, a broad range of preventive interventions have been investigated. Electronic fetal monitoring has not helped to prevent CP, and in 2014 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada have acknowledged that there are no long-term benefits of electronic fetal monitoring. Before this, electronic fetal monitoring was widely used to prop up obstetric litigation. In those at risk of an early delivery, magnesium sulphate appears to decrease the risk of cerebral palsy. It is unclear if it helps those who are born at term. In those at high risk of preterm labor a review found that moderate to severe CP was reduced by the administration of magnesium sulphate, and that adverse effects on the babies from the magnesium sulphate were not significant. Mothers who received magnesium sulphate could experience side effects such as respiratory depression and nausea. However, guidelines for the use of magnesium sulfate in mothers at risk of preterm labour are not strongly adhered to; in 2017 only 2 in 3 eligible women in the UK received the medication despite it being recommended by NICE guidelines. An NHS quality improvement programme increased its usage in England from 71% in 2018 to 83% in 2020. Caffeine is used to treat apnea of prematurity and reduces the risk of cerebral palsy in premature babies, but there are also concerns of long term negative effects. A moderate quality level of evidence indicates that giving women antibiotics during preterm labor before her membranes have ruptured (water is not yet not broken) may increase the risk of cerebral palsy for the child. Additionally, for preterm babies for whom there is a chance of fetal compromise, allowing the birth to proceed rather than trying to delay the birth may lead to an increased risk of cerebral palsy in the child. Corticosteroids are sometimes taken by pregnant women expecting a preterm birth to provide neuroprotection to their baby. Taking corticosteroids during pregnancy is shown to have no significant correlation with developing cerebral palsy in preterm births. Cooling high-risk full-term babies shortly after birth may reduce disability, but this may only be useful for some forms of the brain damage that causes CP. Over time, the approach to CP management has shifted away from narrow attempts to fix individual physical problems – such as spasticity in a particular limb – to making such treatments part of a larger goal of maximizing the person's independence and community engagement. However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of intervention programs reflecting the philosophy of independence has not yet caught up: effective interventions for body structures and functions have a strong evidence base, but evidence is lacking for effective interventions targeted toward participation, environment, or personal factors. There is also no good evidence to show that an intervention that is effective at the body-specific level will result in an improvement at the activity level or vice versa. Although such cross-over benefit might happen, not enough high-quality studies have been done to demonstrate it. Because cerebral palsy has ""varying severity and complexity"" across the lifespan, it can be considered a collection of conditions for management purposes. A multidisciplinary approach for cerebral palsy management is recommended, focusing on ""maximising individual function, choice and independence"" in line with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health's goals. The team may include a paediatrician, a health visitor, a social worker, a physiotherapist, an orthotist, a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, a teacher specialising in helping children with visual impairment, an educational psychologist, an orthopaedic surgeon, a neurologist and a neurosurgeon. Various forms of therapy are available to people living with cerebral palsy as well as caregivers and parents. Treatment may include one or more of the following: physical therapy; occupational therapy; speech therapy; water therapy; drugs to control seizures, alleviate pain, or relax muscle spasms (e.g. benzodiazepines); surgery to correct anatomical abnormalities or release tight muscles; braces and other orthotic devices; rolling walkers; and communication aids such as computers with attached voice synthesisers. Intensive rehabilitation is practiced in certain countries, but obtaining reliable data on its medium and long-term effectiveness is challenging. Surgical intervention in CP children may include various orthopaedic or neurological surgeries to improve quality of life, such as tendon releases, hip rotation, spinal fusion, (selective dorsal rhizotomy) or placement of an intrathecal baclofen pump. A Cochrane review published in 2004 found a trend toward the benefit of speech and language therapy for children with cerebral palsy but noted the need for high-quality research. A 2013 systematic review found that many of the therapies used to treat CP have no good evidence base; the treatments with the best evidence are medications (anticonvulsants, botulinum toxin, bisphosphonates, diazepam), therapy (bimanual training, casting, constraint-induced movement therapy, context-focused therapy, fitness training, goal-directed training, hip surveillance, home programmes, occupational therapy after botulinum toxin, pressure care) and surgery. There is also research on whether the sleeping position might improve hip migration, but there are not yet high-quality evidence studies to support that theory.

Cervical spondylosis,,"Cervical spondylosis is a general term for age-related wear and tear affecting the spinal disks in your neck. As the disks dehydrate and shrink, signs of osteoarthritis develop, including bony projections along the edges of bones (bone spurs).","Many of the treatments for cervical spondylosis have not been subjected to rigorous, controlled trials. Surgery is advocated for cervical radiculopathy in patients who have intractable pain, progressive symptoms, or weakness that fails to improve with conservative therapy.

Chagas Disease,"Fever, fatigue, body aches, heart and digestive problems",,"Efforts to prevent Chagas disease have largely focused on vector control to limit exposure to triatomine bugs. Insecticide-spraying programs have been the mainstay of vector control, consisting of spraying homes and the surrounding areas with residual insecticides. This was originally done with organochlorine, organophosphate, and carbamate insecticides, which were supplanted in the 1980s with pyrethroids. These programs have drastically reduced transmission in Brazil and Chile, and eliminated major vectors from certain regions: Triatoma infestans from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and parts of Peru and Paraguay, as well as Rhodnius prolixus from Central America. Vector control in some regions has been hindered by the development of insecticide resistance among triatomine bugs. In response, vector control programs have implemented alternative insecticides (e.g. fenitrothion and bendiocarb in Argentina and Bolivia), treatment of domesticated animals (which are also fed on by triatomine bugs) with pesticides, pesticide-impregnated paints, and other experimental approaches. In areas with triatomine bugs, transmission of T. cruzi can be prevented by sleeping under bed nets and by housing improvements that prevent triatomine bugs from colonizing houses. Blood transfusion was formerly the second-most common mode of transmission for Chagas disease. T. cruzi can survive in refrigerated stored blood, and can survive freezing and thawing, allowing it to persist in whole blood, packed red blood cells, granulocytes, cryoprecipitate, and platelets. The development and implementation of blood bank screening tests have dramatically reduced the risk of infection during a blood transfusion. Nearly all blood donations in Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening. Widespread screening is also common in non-endemic nations with significant populations of immigrants from endemic areas, including the United Kingdom (implemented in 1999), Spain (2005), the United States (2007), France and Sweden (2009), Switzerland (2012), and Belgium (2013). Serological tests, typically ELISAs, are used to detect antibodies against T. cruzi proteins in donor blood. Other modes of transmission have been targeted by Chagas disease prevention programs. Treating T. cruzi-infected mothers during pregnancy reduces the risk of congenital transmission of the infection. To this end, many countries in Latin America have implemented routine screening of pregnant women and infants for T. cruzi infection, and the World Health Organization recommends screening all children born to infected mothers to prevent congenital infection from developing into chronic disease. Similarly to blood transfusions, many countries with endemic Chagas disease screen organs for transplantation with serological tests. There is no vaccine against Chagas disease. Several experimental vaccines have been tested in animals infected with T. cruzi and were able to reduce parasite numbers in the blood and heart, but no vaccine candidates had undergone clinical trials in humans as of 2016. Chagas disease is managed using antiparasitic drugs to eliminate T. cruzi from the body, and symptomatic treatment to address the effects of the infection. As of 2018, benznidazole and nifurtimox were the antiparasitic drugs of choice for treating Chagas disease, though benznidazole is the only drug available in most of Latin America. For either drug, treatment typically consists of two to three oral doses per day for 60 to 90 days. Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection: it eliminates T. cruzi from 50 to 80% of people in the acute phase (WHO: ""nearly 100 %""), but only 20–60% of those in the chronic phase. Treatment of chronic disease is more effective in children than in adults, and the cure rate for congenital disease approaches 100% if treated in the first year of life. Antiparasitic treatment can also slow the progression of the disease and reduce the possibility of congenital transmission. Elimination of T. cruzi does not cure the cardiac and gastrointestinal damage caused by chronic Chagas disease, so these conditions must be treated separately. Antiparasitic treatment is not recommended for people who have already developed dilated cardiomyopathy. Benznidazole is usually considered the first-line treatment because it has milder adverse effects than nifurtimox, and its efficacy is better understood. Both benznidazole and nifurtimox have common side effects that can result in treatment being discontinued. The most common side effects of benznidazole are skin rash, digestive problems, decreased appetite, weakness, headache, and sleeping problems. These side effects can sometimes be treated with antihistamines or corticosteroids, and are generally reversed when treatment is stopped. However, benznidazole is discontinued in up to 29% of cases. Nifurtimox has more frequent side effects, affecting up to 97.5% of individuals taking the drug. The most common side effects are loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, and various neurological disorders including mood changes, insomnia, paresthesia and peripheral neuropathy. Treatment is discontinued in up to 75% of cases. Both drugs are contraindicated for use in pregnant women and people with liver or kidney failure. As of 2019, resistance to these drugs has been reported.","['fever', 'fatigue', 'body aches', 'heart and digestive problems']","chagas disease fever, fatigue, body aches, heart and digestive problems

Once the diagnosis of cholesteatoma is made in a patient who can tolerate a general anesthetic, the standard treatment is to surgically remove the growth. The challenge of cholesteatoma surgery is to permanently remove the cholesteatoma whilst retaining or reconstructing the normal functions of the structures housed within the temporal bone. The general objective of cholesteatoma surgery has two parts. It is both directed against the underlying pathology and directed towards maintaining the normal functions of the temporal bone. These aims are conflicting and this makes cholesteatoma surgery extremely challenging. Sometimes, the situation results in a clash of surgical aims. The need to fully remove a progressive disease like cholesteatoma is the surgeon's first priority. Preservation of hearing is secondary to this primary aim.

Systemic vasculitis due to autoimmune.","Treatment for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis includes glucocorticoids (such as prednisolone) and other immunosuppressive drugs (such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide). In many cases, the disease can be put into a type of chemical remission through drug therapy, but the disease is chronic and lifelong. A systematic review conducted in 2007 indicated that all patients should be treated with high-dose steroids, but in patients with a five-factor score of one or higher, cyclophosphamide pulse therapy should be commenced, with 12 pulses leading to fewer relapses than six. Remission can be maintained with a less toxic drug, such as azathioprine or methotrexate. On 12 December 2017, the FDA approved mepolizumab, the first drug therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Patients taking mepolizumab experienced a ""significant improvement"" in their symptoms. Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-5, a major factor in eosinophil survival. In addition to mepolizumab, a number of emerging targeted biotherapies—including the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab, immunomodulation with Interferon-α, and B cell therapy with rituximab—may lead to increasingly personalized treatment regimens for future EGPA patients. A review of EGPA treatments conducted in 2020 proposes integrating targeted biotherapies into EGPA management plans following failure of treatment with corticosteroids. On 18 September 2024, AstraZeneca announced FDA approval for Fasenra (benralizumab), a biologic drug therapy indicated for use in adult patients with EGPA, following the MANDARA Phase III trial results. Published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the first head-to-head non-inferiority trial of biologics in patients with relapsing or refractory EGPA measured the efficacy and safety of Fasenra against mepolizumab.

Cirrhosis,"Fatigue, jaundice, abdominal swelling (ascites), easy bruising and bleeding, confusion, loss of appetite, weight loss","Cirrhosis, also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis, chronic liver failure or chronic hepatic failure and end-stage liver disease, is a chronic condition of the liver in which the normal functioning tissue, or parenchyma, is replaced with scar tissue (fibrosis) and regenerative nodules as a result of chronic liver disease. Damage to the liver leads to repair of liver tissue and subsequent formation of scar tissue. Over time, scar tissue and nodules of regenerating hepatocytes can replace the parenchyma, causing increased resistance to blood flow in the liver's capillaries—the hepatic sinusoids—and consequently portal hypertension, as well as impairment in other aspects of liver function.","Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases. Little is known about factors affecting cirrhosis risk and progression. However, many studies have provided increasing evidence for the protective effects of coffee consumption against the progression of liver disease. These effects are more noticeable in liver disease that is associated with alcohol use disorder. Coffee has antioxidant and antifibrotic effects. Caffeine may not be the important component; polyphenols may be more important. Drinking two or more cups of coffee a day is associated with improvements in the liver enzymes ALT, AST, and GGT. Even in those with liver disease, coffee consumption can lower fibrosis and cirrhosis. Generally, liver damage from cirrhosis cannot be reversed, but treatment can stop or delay further progression and reduce complications. A healthy diet is encouraged, as cirrhosis may be an energy-consuming process. A recommended diet consists of a high-protein, high-fiber diet plus supplementation with branched-chain amino acids. Close follow-up is often necessary. Antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. Laxatives, such as lactulose, decrease the risk of constipation. Carvedilol increases survival benefit for people with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Diuretics in combination with a low-salt diet reduce fluid in the body, which helps reduce oedema. Alcoholic cirrhosis caused by alcohol use disorder is treated by abstaining from alcohol. Treatment for hepatitis-related cirrhosis involves medications used to treat the different types of hepatitis, such as interferon for viral hepatitis and corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis. Cirrhosis caused by Wilson's disease is treated by removing the copper which builds up in organs. This is carried out using chelation therapy such as penicillamine. When the cause is an iron overload, iron is removed using a chelation agent such as deferoxamine or by bloodletting. As of 2021, there are recent studies studying drugs to prevent cirrhosis caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD or NASH). The drug semaglutide was shown to provide greater NASH resolution versus placebo. No improvement in fibrosis was observed. A combination of cilofexor/firsocostat was studied in people with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis. It was observed to have led to improvements in NASH activity with a potential antifibrotic effect. Lanifibranor is also shown to prevent worsening fibrosis.","['fatigue', 'jaundice', 'abdominal swelling (ascites)', 'easy bruising and bleeding', 'confusion', 'loss of appetite', 'weight loss']","cirrhosis fatigue, jaundice, abdominal swelling (ascites), easy bruising and bleeding, confusion, loss of appetite, weight loss cirrhosis, also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis, chronic liver failure or chronic hepatic failure and end-stage liver disease, is a chronic condition of the liver in which the normal functioning tissue, or parenchyma, is replaced with scar tissue (fibrosis) and regenerative nodules as a result of chronic liver disease. damage to the liver leads to repair of liver tissue and subsequent formation of scar tissue. over time, scar tissue and nodules of regenerating hepatocytes can replace the parenchyma, causing increased resistance to blood flow in the liver s capillaries the hepatic sinusoids and consequently portal hypertension, as well as impairment in other aspects of liver function. key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases. little is known about factors affecting cirrhosis risk and progression. however, many studies have provided increasing evidence for the protective effects of coffee consumption against the progression of liver disease. these effects are more noticeable in liver disease that is associated with alcohol use disorder. coffee has antioxidant and antifibrotic effects. caffeine may not be the important component polyphenols may be more important. drinking two or more cups of coffee a day is associated with improvements in the liver enzymes alt, ast, and ggt. even in those with liver disease, coffee consumption can lower fibrosis and cirrhosis. generally, liver damage from cirrhosis cannot be reversed, but treatment can stop or delay further progression and reduce complications. a healthy diet is encouraged, as cirrhosis may be an energy-consuming process. a recommended diet consists of a high-protein, high-fiber diet plus supplementation with branched-chain amino acids. close follow-up is often necessary. antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. laxatives, such as lactulose, decrease the risk of constipation. carvedilol increases survival benefit for people with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. diuretics in combination with a low-salt diet reduce fluid in the body, which helps reduce oedema. alcoholic cirrhosis caused by alcohol use disorder is treated by abstaining from alcohol. treatment for hepatitis-related cirrhosis involves medications used to treat the different types of hepatitis, such as interferon for viral hepatitis and corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis. cirrhosis caused by wilson s disease is treated by removing the copper which builds up in organs. this is carried out using chelation therapy such as penicillamine. when the cause is an iron overload, iron is removed using a chelation agent such as deferoxamine or by bloodletting. as of 2021, there are recent studies studying drugs to prevent cirrhosis caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld or nash). the drug semaglutide was shown to provide greater nash resolution versus placebo. no improvement in fibrosis was observed. a combination of cilofexor/firsocostat was studied in people with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis. it was observed to have led to improvements in nash activity with a potential antifibrotic effect. lanifibranor is also shown to prevent worsening fibrosis."

Instead, airborne precautions such as respirators, ventilation, and HEPA/high MERV filters, are the only reliable protection against cold-laden aerosols. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold.

Protective equipment such as helmets and other headgear and policy changes such as the banning of body checking in youth hockey leagues have been found to reduce the number and severity of concussions in athletes. Secondary prevention such as a Return to Play Protocol for an athlete may reduce the risk of repeat concussions.

Educational interventions, such as handouts, videos, workshops, and lectures, can improve concussion knowledge of diverse groups, particularly youth athletes and coaches. Strong concussion knowledge may be associated with greater recognition of concussion symptoms, higher rates of concussion reporting behaviors, and reduced body checking-related penalties and injuries, thereby lowering risk of mTBI. Due to the incidence of concussion in sport, younger athletes often do not disclose concussions and their symptoms. Common reasons for non-disclosure include a lack of awareness of the concussion, the belief that the concussion was not serious enough, and not wanting to leave the game or team due to their injury. Changes to the rules or enforcing existing rules in sports, such as those against ""head-down tackling"", or ""spearing"", which is associated with a high injury rate, may prevent concussions. Adults and children with a suspected concussion require a medical assessment with a doctor or nurse practitioner to confirm the diagnosis of concussion and rule out more serious head injuries. After life-threatening head injuries, injuries to the cervical spine, and neurological conditions are ruled out, observation should be continued for several hours. If repeated vomiting, worsening headache, dizziness, seizures, excessive drowsiness, double vision, slurred speech, unsteady walk, or weakness or numbness in arms or legs, or signs of basilar skull fracture develop, immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed.

Rubella infection in pregnancy can result in various outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to congenital defects to miscarriage and fetal death.","Vaccinating the majority of the population is effective at preventing congenital rubella syndrome. With the introduction of the rubella vaccine in 1969, the number of cases of rubella in the United States has decreased 99%, from 57,686 cases in 1969 to 271 cases in 1999. For women who plan to become pregnant, the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination is highly recommended, at least 28 days before conception. The vaccine should not be given to women who are already pregnant as it contains live viral particles. Other preventative actions can include the screening and vaccinations of high-risk personnel, such as medical and child care professionals. Infants with birth defects suspected to be caused by congenital rubella infection should be investigated thoroughly. Confirmed cases should be reported to the local or state health department to assess control of the virus, and isolation of the infant should be maintained. Infants with known rubella exposure during pregnancy or those with a confirmed or suspected infection should receive close follow-up and supportive care. There are no medications or antivirals that will shorten the clinical course of the virus. Only those with immunity to rubella should have contact with infected infants, as they can shed viral particles in their respiratory secretions through 1 year of age (unless they test with repeated negative viral cultures at age 3 months). Many infants can be born with multiple birth defects that require multidisciplinary management and interventions based on clinical manifestations. Often, these infants will require an extended period or lifelong follow-up with medical specialists. Early diagnosis of congenital rubella syndrome is important for planning future medical care and educational placement.","['developmental delays', 'intellectual disability', 'hearing loss', 'vision problems', 'heart defects', 'liver or spleen enlargement', 'rash at birth']","congenital rubella developmental delays, intellectual disability, hearing loss, vision problems, heart defects, liver or spleen enlargement, rash at birth congenital rubella syndrome (crs) occurs when a human fetus is infected with the rubella virus (german measles) via maternal-fetal transmission and develops birth defects. the most common congenital defects affect the ophthalmologic, cardiac, auditory, and neurologic systems. rubella infection in pregnancy can result in various outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to congenital defects to miscarriage and fetal death. vaccinating the majority of the population is effective at preventing congenital rubella syndrome. with the introduction of the rubella vaccine in 1969, the number of cases of rubella in the united states has decreased 99 , from 57,686 cases in 1969 to 271 cases in 1999. for women who plan to become pregnant, the mmr (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination is highly recommended, at least 28 days before conception. the vaccine should not be given to women who are already pregnant as it contains live viral particles. other preventative actions can include the screening and vaccinations of high-risk personnel, such as medical and child care professionals. infants with birth defects suspected to be caused by congenital rubella infection should be investigated thoroughly. confirmed cases should be reported to the local or state health department to assess control of the virus, and isolation of the infant should be maintained. infants with known rubella exposure during pregnancy or those with a confirmed or suspected infection should receive close follow-up and supportive care. there are no medications or antivirals that will shorten the clinical course of the virus. only those with immunity to rubella should have contact with infected infants, as they can shed viral particles in their respiratory secretions through 1 year of age (unless they test with repeated negative viral cultures at age 3 months). many infants can be born with multiple birth defects that require multidisciplinary management and interventions based on clinical manifestations. often, these infants will require an extended period or lifelong follow-up with medical specialists. early diagnosis of congenital rubella syndrome is important for planning future medical care and educational placement."

No clear association of the tumor exists with a particular gender or race. Craniopharyngiomas do not appear to ""run in families"" or to be directly inherited from the parents. Treatment generally consists of subfrontal or transsphenoidal excision. Endoscopic surgery through the nose often performed by a team of neurosurgeons and ENT, is an alternative to transcranial surgery done by making an opening in the skull. Because of the location of the craniopharyngioma in the skull base of the brain, a surgical navigation system might be used to verify the position of surgical tools during the operation. Additional radiotherapy is used if total removal is not possible. Due to the poor outcomes associated with damage to the pituitary and hypothalamus from surgical removal and radiation, experimental therapies using intracavitary phosphorus-32, yttrium, or bleomycin delivered via an external reservoir are sometimes employed, especially in young patients.

Cryptococcosis,"Headache, fever, fatigue, cough, meningitis, pneumonia","Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior.","Cryptococcosis is a very subacute infection with a prolonged subclinical phase lasting weeks to months in persons with HIV/AIDS before the onset of symptomatic meningitis. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence rate of detectable cryptococcal antigen in peripheral blood is often 4–12% in persons with CD4 counts lower than 100 cells/mcL. Cryptococcal antigen screen and preemptive treatment with fluconazole are cost-saving to the healthcare system by avoiding cryptococcal meningitis. The World Health Organization recommends cryptococcal antigen screening in HIV-infected persons entering care with CD4<100 cells/μL. This undetected subclinical cryptococcal (if not preemptively treated with anti-fungal therapy) will often go on to develop cryptococcal meningitis, despite receiving HIV therapy. Cryptococcosis accounts for 20–25% of the mortality after initiating HIV therapy in Africa. What is effective preemptive treatment is unknown, with the current recommendations on dose and duration based on expert opinion. Screening in the United States is controversial, with official guidelines not recommending screening, despite cost-effectiveness and a 3% U.S. cryptococcal antigen prevalence in CD4<100 cells/μL. Antifungal prophylaxis such as fluconazole and itraconazole reduces the risk of contracting cryptococcosis in those with low CD4 cell count and high risk of developing such disease in a setting of cryptococcal antigen screening tests are not available. Treatment options for persons without HIV infection have not been well studied. Intravenous amphotericin B combined with flucytosine by mouth is recommended for initial treatment (induction therapy). People living with AIDS often have a greater burden of disease and higher mortality (30–70% at 10 weeks). Recommended therapy is with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Adding flucytosine to amphotericin B is associated with earlier fungal clearance and increased survival; however, it is not readily available in many lower-income regions. Where flucytosine is not available, fluconazole should be used with amphotericin. Amphotericin-based induction therapy has much greater microbiologic activity than fluconazole monotherapy with 30% better survival at 10 weeks. Based on a systematic review, the most cost-effective induction treatment in resource-limited settings appears to be one week of amphotericin B coupled with high-dose fluconazole. After initial induction treatment as above, typical consolidation therapy is with oral fluconazole for at least 8 weeks, used with secondary prophylaxis with fluconazole thereafter. The decision on when to start treatment for HIV appears to be very different than other opportunistic infections. A large multi-site trial supports deferring ART for 4–6 weeks was overall preferable with 15% better 1-year survival than earlier ART initiation at 1–2 weeks after diagnosis. A 2018 Cochrane review also supports the delayed starting of treatment until cryptococcosis starts improving with antifungal treatment. Increased intracranial pressure is seen in about 50% of those with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis and is usually associated with a high fungal burden. Regular (often daily) lumbar punctures to lower the intracranial pressure by draining CSF is associated with reduced mortality in those with cryptococcal meningitis (with or without HIV). But in those with suspicion of non-communicating hydrocephalus (which may present as focal neurologic symptoms or impaired mentation), a CT or MRI of the brain is required before lumbar puncture to rule out hydrocephalus, due to the risk of brain herniation with lumbar puncture. Non-communicating hydrocephalus is rare in those with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.","['headache', 'fever', 'fatigue', 'cough', 'meningitis', 'pneumonia']","cryptococcosis headache, fever, fatigue, cough, meningitis, pneumonia cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. when the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior. cryptococcosis is a very subacute infection with a prolonged subclinical phase lasting weeks to months in persons with hiv/aids before the onset of symptomatic meningitis. in sub-saharan africa, the prevalence rate of detectable cryptococcal antigen in peripheral blood is often 4 12 in persons with cd4 counts lower than 100 cells/mcl. cryptococcal antigen screen and preemptive treatment with fluconazole are cost-saving to the healthcare system by avoiding cryptococcal meningitis. the world health organization recommends cryptococcal antigen screening in hiv-infected persons entering care with cd4 100 cells/ l. this undetected subclinical cryptococcal (if not preemptively treated with anti-fungal therapy) will often go on to develop cryptococcal meningitis, despite receiving hiv therapy. cryptococcosis accounts for 20 25 of the mortality after initiating hiv therapy in africa. what is effective preemptive treatment is unknown, with the current recommendations on dose and duration based on expert opinion. screening in the united states is controversial, with official guidelines not recommending screening, despite cost-effectiveness and a 3 u.s. cryptococcal antigen prevalence in cd4 100 cells/ l. antifungal prophylaxis such as fluconazole and itraconazole reduces the risk of contracting cryptococcosis in those with low cd4 cell count and high risk of developing such disease in a setting of cryptococcal antigen screening tests are not available. treatment options for persons without hiv infection have not been well studied. intravenous amphotericin b combined with flucytosine by mouth is recommended for initial treatment (induction therapy). people living with aids often have a greater burden of disease and higher mortality (30 70 at 10 weeks). recommended therapy is with amphotericin b and flucytosine. adding flucytosine to amphotericin b is associated with earlier fungal clearance and increased survival however, it is not readily available in many lower-income regions. where flucytosine is not available, fluconazole should be used with amphotericin. amphotericin-based induction therapy has much greater microbiologic activity than fluconazole monotherapy with 30 better survival at 10 weeks. based on a systematic review, the most cost-effective induction treatment in resource-limited settings appears to be one week of amphotericin b coupled with high-dose fluconazole. after initial induction treatment as above, typical consolidation therapy is with oral fluconazole for at least 8 weeks, used with secondary prophylaxis with fluconazole thereafter. the decision on when to start treatment for hiv appears to be very different than other opportunistic infections. a large multi-site trial supports deferring art for 4 6 weeks was overall preferable with 15 better 1-year survival than earlier art initiation at 1 2 weeks after diagnosis. a 2018 cochrane review also supports the delayed starting of treatment until cryptococcosis starts improving with antifungal treatment. increased intracranial pressure is seen in about 50 of those with hiv-associated cryptococcal meningitis and is usually associated with a high fungal burden. regular (often daily) lumbar punctures to lower the intracranial pressure by draining csf is associated with reduced mortality in those with cryptococcal meningitis (with or without hiv). but in those with suspicion of non-communicating hydrocephalus (which may present as focal neurologic symptoms or impaired mentation), a ct or mri of the brain is required before lumbar puncture to rule out hydrocephalus, due to the risk of brain herniation with lumbar puncture. non-communicating hydrocephalus is rare in those with hiv-associated cryptococcal meningitis."
Cryptorchidism,"Absence or undescended testicle(s), empty scrotum, smaller or underdeveloped testicle(s), inguinal hernia, abnormal positioning of the testicle(s) (higher in the groin area)","Cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis (UDT), is the failure of one or both testicles to descend into the scrotum. The word is from Ancient Greek κρυπτός (kryptos) 'hidden' and ὄρχις (orchis) 'testicle'. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital tract.","The primary management of cryptorchidism is watchful waiting, due to the high likelihood of self-resolution. Where this fails, orchiopexy is effective if inguinal testes have not descended after 4–6 months. Surgery is often performed by a pediatric urologist or pediatric surgeon, but in many communities, still by a general urologist or surgeon. Since undescended testicles do not descend after the first months of life, waiting longer only delays treatment. When the undescended testis is in the inguinal canal, hormonal therapy is sometimes attempted and very occasionally successful. The most commonly used hormone therapy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). A series of hCG injections (10 injections over five weeks is common) is given, and the status of the testis/testes is reassessed at the end. Although many trials have been published, the reported success rates range widely, from roughly 5% to 50%, probably reflecting the varying criteria for distinguishing retractile testes from low inguinal testes. Hormone treatment does have the occasional incidental benefits of allowing confirmation of Leydig cell responsiveness (proven by a rise of the testosterone by the end of the injections) or inducing additional growth of a small penis (via the testosterone rise). Some surgeons have reported facilitation of surgery, perhaps by enhancing the size, vascularity, or healing of the tissue. A newer hormonal intervention used in Europe is the use of GnRH analogs such as nafarelin or buserelin; the success rates and putative mechanism of action are similar to hCG, but some surgeons have combined the two treatments and reported higher descent rates. Limited evidence suggests that germ cell count is slightly better after hormone treatment; whether this translates into better sperm counts and fertility rates at maturity has not been established. The cost of either type of hormone treatment is less than that of surgery, and the chance of complications at appropriate doses is minimal. Nevertheless, despite the potential advantages of a trial of hormonal therapy, many surgeons do not consider the success rates high enough to be worth the trouble, since the surgery itself is usually simple and uncomplicated. In cases where the testes are identified preoperatively in the inguinal canal, orchiopexy is often performed as an outpatient and has a very low complication rate. An incision is made over the inguinal canal. The testis with accompanying cord structure and blood supply is exposed, partially separated from the surrounding tissues (""mobilized""), and brought into the scrotum. It is sutured to the scrotal tissue or enclosed in a ""subdartos pouch"". The associated passage back into the inguinal canal is closed to prevent reascension. In patients with intra-abdominal maldescended testis, laparoscopy is useful to see for oneself the pelvic structures, position of the testis, and decide upon surgery (single or staged procedure). Surgery becomes more complicated if the blood supply is not ample and elastic enough to be stretched into the scrotum. In these cases, the supply may be divided, some vessels sacrificed with the expectation of adequate collateral circulation. In the worst case, the testis must be ""autotransplanted"" into the scrotum, with all connecting blood vessels cut and reconnected (anastomosed). When the testis is in the abdomen, the first stage of surgery is exploration to locate it, assess its viability, and determine the safest way to maintain or establish the blood supply. Multistage surgeries, or autotransplantation and anastomosis, are more often necessary in these situations. Just as often, intra-abdominal exploration discovers that the testis is nonexistent (""vanished""), or dysplastic and not salvageable. The principal major complication of all types of orchiopexy is a loss of the blood supply to the testis, resulting in loss of the testis due to ischemic atrophy or fibrosis.","['absence or undescended testicle(s)', 'empty scrotum', 'smaller or underdeveloped testicle(s)', 'inguinal hernia', 'abnormal positioning of the testicle(s) (higher in the groin area)']","cryptorchidism absence or undescended testicle(s), empty scrotum, smaller or underdeveloped testicle(s), inguinal hernia, abnormal positioning of the testicle(s) (higher in the groin area) cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis (udt), is the failure of one or both testicles to descend into the scrotum. the word is from ancient greek (kryptos) hidden and (orchis) testicle . it is the most common birth defect of the male genital tract. the primary management of cryptorchidism is watchful waiting, due to the high likelihood of self-resolution. where this fails, orchiopexy is effective if inguinal testes have not descended after 4 6 months. surgery is often performed by a pediatric urologist or pediatric surgeon, but in many communities, still by a general urologist or surgeon. since undescended testicles do not descend after the first months of life, waiting longer only delays treatment. when the undescended testis is in the inguinal canal, hormonal therapy is sometimes attempted and very occasionally successful. the most commonly used hormone therapy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). a series of hcg injections (10 injections over five weeks is common) is given, and the status of the testis/testes is reassessed at the end. although many trials have been published, the reported success rates range widely, from roughly 5 to 50 , probably reflecting the varying criteria for distinguishing retractile testes from low inguinal testes. hormone treatment does have the occasional incidental benefits of allowing confirmation of leydig cell responsiveness (proven by a rise of the testosterone by the end of the injections) or inducing additional growth of a small penis (via the testosterone rise). some surgeons have reported facilitation of surgery, perhaps by enhancing the size, vascularity, or healing of the tissue. a newer hormonal intervention used in europe is the use of gnrh analogs such as nafarelin or buserelin the success rates and putative mechanism of action are similar to hcg, but some surgeons have combined the two treatments and reported higher descent rates. limited evidence suggests that germ cell count is slightly better after hormone treatment whether this translates into better sperm counts and fertility rates at maturity has not been established. the cost of either type of hormone treatment is less than that of surgery, and the chance of complications at appropriate doses is minimal. nevertheless, despite the potential advantages of a trial of hormonal therapy, many surgeons do not consider the success rates high enough to be worth the trouble, since the surgery itself is usually simple and uncomplicated. in cases where the testes are identified preoperatively in the inguinal canal, orchiopexy is often performed as an outpatient and has a very low complication rate. an incision is made over the inguinal canal. the testis with accompanying cord structure and blood supply is exposed, partially separated from the surrounding tissues ( mobilized ), and brought into the scrotum. it is sutured to the scrotal tissue or enclosed in a subdartos pouch . the associated passage back into the inguinal canal is closed to prevent reascension. in patients with intra-abdominal maldescended testis, laparoscopy is useful to see for oneself the pelvic structures, position of the testis, and decide upon surgery (single or staged procedure). surgery becomes more complicated if the blood supply is not ample and elastic enough to be stretched into the scrotum. in these cases, the supply may be divided, some vessels sacrificed with the expectation of adequate collateral circulation. in the worst case, the testis must be autotransplanted into the scrotum, with all connecting blood vessels cut and reconnected (anastomosed). when the testis is in the abdomen, the first stage of surgery is exploration to locate it, assess its viability, and determine the safest way to maintain or establish the blood supply. multistage surgeries, or autotransplantation and anastomosis, are more often necessary in these situations. just as often, intra-abdominal exploration discovers that the testis is nonexistent ( vanished ), or dysplastic and not salvageable. the principal major complication of all types of orchiopexy is a loss of the blood supply to the testis, resulting in loss of the testis due to ischemic atrophy or fibrosis."

Cystic Fibrosis,"Persistent cough with thick mucus, recurrent lung infections, poor growth or weight gain, salty-tasting skin","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner that impairs the normal clearance of mucus from the lungs, which facilitates the colonization and infection of the lungs by bacteria, notably Staphylococcus aureus. CF is a rare genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine. The hallmark feature of CF is the accumulation of thick mucus in different organs.","Treatment for CF is diverse, tailored to different symptoms, and includes various devices, inhalation medications to alleviate respiratory difficulties, oral enzyme supplements to address exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and, in some cases, surgical interventions for conditions such as meconium ileus. While treatment alleviates symptoms and prevents potential complications, there is currently no cure for the disease. The management of CF has improved significantly over the past 70 years. While infants born with it 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood. Advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis have meant that people with cystic fibrosis can live a fuller life less encumbered by their condition. The cornerstones of management are the proactive treatment of airway infection, encouragement of good nutrition, and an active lifestyle. Pulmonary rehabilitation as a management of CF continues throughout a person's life, and is aimed at maximizing organ function, and therefore the quality of life. Occupational therapists use energy conservation techniques in the rehabilitation process for patients with cystic fibrosis. Examples of energy conservation techniques are ergonomic principles, pursed lip breathing, and diaphragmatic breathing. People with CF tend to have fatigue and dyspnoea due to chronic pulmonary infections, so reducing the amount of energy spent during activities can help people feel better and gain more independence. At best, current treatments delay the decline in organ function. Because of the wide variation in disease symptoms, treatment typically occurs at specialist multidisciplinary centers and is tailored to the individual. Targets for therapy are the lungs, gastrointestinal tract (including pancreatic enzyme supplements), the reproductive organs (including assisted reproductive technology), and psychological support. The most consistent aspect of therapy in CF is limiting and treating the lung damage caused by thick mucus and infection, with the goal of maintaining quality of life. Intravenous, inhaled, and oral antibiotics are used to treat chronic and acute infections. Mechanical devices and inhalation medications are used to alter and clear the thickened mucus. These therapies, while effective, can be extremely time-consuming. Oxygen therapy at home is recommended in those with significantly low oxygen levels. Many people with CF use probiotics, which are thought to be able to correct intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation, but the clinical trial evidence regarding the effectiveness of probiotics for reducing pulmonary exacerbations in people with CF is uncertain.","['persistent cough with thick mucus', 'recurrent lung infections', 'poor growth or weight gain', 'salty-tasting skin']","cystic fibrosis persistent cough with thick mucus, recurrent lung infections, poor growth or weight gain, salty-tasting skin cystic fibrosis (cf) is a genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner that impairs the normal clearance of mucus from the lungs, which facilitates the colonization and infection of the lungs by bacteria, notably staphylococcus aureus. cf is a rare genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine. the hallmark feature of cf is the accumulation of thick mucus in different organs. treatment for cf is diverse, tailored to different symptoms, and includes various devices, inhalation medications to alleviate respiratory difficulties, oral enzyme supplements to address exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and, in some cases, surgical interventions for conditions such as meconium ileus. while treatment alleviates symptoms and prevents potential complications, there is currently no cure for the disease. the management of cf has improved significantly over the past 70 years. while infants born with it 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood. advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis have meant that people with cystic fibrosis can live a fuller life less encumbered by their condition. the cornerstones of management are the proactive treatment of airway infection, encouragement of good nutrition, and an active lifestyle. pulmonary rehabilitation as a management of cf continues throughout a person s life, and is aimed at maximizing organ function, and therefore the quality of life. occupational therapists use energy conservation techniques in the rehabilitation process for patients with cystic fibrosis. examples of energy conservation techniques are ergonomic principles, pursed lip breathing, and diaphragmatic breathing. people with cf tend to have fatigue and dyspnoea due to chronic pulmonary infections, so reducing the amount of energy spent during activities can help people feel better and gain more independence. at best, current treatments delay the decline in organ function. because of the wide variation in disease symptoms, treatment typically occurs at specialist multidisciplinary centers and is tailored to the individual. targets for therapy are the lungs, gastrointestinal tract (including pancreatic enzyme supplements), the reproductive organs (including assisted reproductive technology), and psychological support. the most consistent aspect of therapy in cf is limiting and treating the lung damage caused by thick mucus and infection, with the goal of maintaining quality of life. intravenous, inhaled, and oral antibiotics are used to treat chronic and acute infections. mechanical devices and inhalation medications are used to alter and clear the thickened mucus. these therapies, while effective, can be extremely time-consuming. oxygen therapy at home is recommended in those with significantly low oxygen levels. many people with cf use probiotics, which are thought to be able to correct intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation, but the clinical trial evidence regarding the effectiveness of probiotics for reducing pulmonary exacerbations in people with cf is uncertain."

In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group. Using urinary catheters as little and as short of time as possible and appropriate care of the catheter when used prevents catheter-associated urinary tract infections.

This typically involves problems with memory, thinking, behavior, and motor control. Aside from memory impairment and a disruption in thought patterns, the most common symptoms of dementia include emotional problems, difficulties with language, and decreased motivation.","There are limited options for treating dementia, with most approaches focused on managing or reducing individual symptoms. There are no treatment options available to delay the onset of dementia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are often used early in the disorder course; however, benefit is generally small. More than half of people with dementia may experience psychological or behavioral symptoms including agitation, sleep problems, aggression, and/or psychosis. Treatment for these symptoms is aimed at reducing the person's distress and keeping the person safe. Treatments other than medication appear to be better for agitation and aggression. Cognitive and behavioral interventions may be appropriate. Some evidence suggests that education and support for the person with dementia, as well as caregivers and family members, improves outcomes. Exercise programs are beneficial with respect to activities of daily living. As with all brain disorders, some people with dementia could potentially be a danger to themselves or others. Such behavioral symptoms might result in the person being involuntarily admitted to a mental health ward for assessment, care and treatment. However, this is a last resort, and potential alternatives could be considered by family or friends of people with dementia. Palliative care interventions may lead to improvements in the quality of life, management of symptoms, and comfort in dying, but it is not yet known how it can be best used to support people dying with advanced dementia and their families. The effect of therapies can be evaluated for example by assessing agitation using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI); by assessing mood and engagement with the Menorah Park Engagement Scale (MPES); and the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) or by assessing indicators for depression using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) or a simplified version thereof.

Diabetes,"Frequent thirst, frequent urination, wounds take a long time to heal","Frequent thirst, frequent urination, wounds take a long time to heal. Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.","There is no known preventive measure for type 1 diabetes. However, islet autoimmunity and multiple antibodies can be a strong predictor of the onset of type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes—which accounts for 85–90% of all cases worldwide—can often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and eating a healthy diet. Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%. Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish. Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes. Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well. The relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change: globalization, urbanization, population aging, and the general health policy environment. Diabetes management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. This can usually be accomplished with dietary changes, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin, oral medications). Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels. The goal of treatment is an HbA1C level below 7%. Attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the negative effects of diabetes. These include smoking, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and lack of regular exercise. Specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of diabetic foot ulcers by relieving the pressure on the foot. Foot examination for patients living with diabetes should be done annually which includes sensation testing, foot biomechanics, vascular integrity and foot structure. Concerning those with severe mental illness, the efficacy of type 2 diabetes self-management interventions is still poorly explored, with insufficient scientific evidence to show whether these interventions have similar results to those observed in the general population.","['frequent thirst', 'frequent urination', 'wounds take a long time to heal']","diabetes frequent thirst, frequent urination, wounds take a long time to heal frequent thirst, frequent urination, wounds take a long time to heal. diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. there is no known preventive measure for type 1 diabetes. however, islet autoimmunity and multiple antibodies can be a strong predictor of the onset of type 1 diabetes. type 2 diabetes which accounts for 85 90 of all cases worldwide can often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and eating a healthy diet. higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28 . dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish. limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes. tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well. the relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. there is growing evidence that the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change globalization, urbanization, population aging, and the general health policy environment. diabetes management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. this can usually be accomplished with dietary changes, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin, oral medications). learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels. the goal of treatment is an hba1c level below 7 . attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the negative effects of diabetes. these include smoking, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and lack of regular exercise. specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of diabetic foot ulcers by relieving the pressure on the foot. foot examination for patients living with diabetes should be done annually which includes sensation testing, foot biomechanics, vascular integrity and foot structure. concerning those with severe mental illness, the efficacy of type 2 diabetes self-management interventions is still poorly explored, with insufficient scientific evidence to show whether these interventions have similar results to those observed in the general population."

The term was introduced by Robert Spitzer in the late 1970s as a replacement for the concept of ""depressive personality."" With the DSM-5's publication in 2013, the condition assumed its current name (i.e., PDD), having been called dysthymic disorder in the DSM's previous edition (DSM-IV), and remaining so in ICD-11. PDD is defined by a 2-year history of symptoms of major depression not better explained by another health condition, as well as significant distress or functional impairment.","Though there is no clear-cut way to prevent dysthymia from occurring, there are some suggestions to help reduce its effects. Since dysthymia often appears first in childhood, it is important to identify children who may be at risk.

Endophthalmitis,"Eye pain, redness, swelling, blurred vision, decreased vision, floaters (dark spots or cobwebs in the vision), increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), discharge from the eye, excessive tearing, fever","Endophthalmitis, or endophthalmia, is inflammation of the interior cavity of the eye, usually caused by an infection. It is a possible complication of all intraocular surgeries, particularly cataract surgery, and can result in loss of vision or loss of the eye itself. Infection can be caused by bacteria or fungi, and is classified as exogenous (infection introduced by direct inoculation as in surgery or penetrating trauma), or endogenous (organisms carried by blood vessels to the eye from another site of infection and is more common in people who have an immunocompromised state).","Different approaches have been suggested to prevent exogenous endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. Perioperative antibiotic injections into the eye, specifically cefuroxime at the end of surgery, lowers the chance of endophthalmitis. Moderate evidence also supports antibiotic eye drops (levofloxacin or chloramphenicol) with antibiotic injections (cefuroxime or penicillin) to reduce the risk of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery compared with injections or eye drops alone. Periocular injection of penicillin along with chloramphenicol-suphadimidine eye drops and an intracameral cefuroxime injection with topical levofloxacin also reduces the risk reduction of developing endophthalmitis following cataract surgery for some people. For people undergoing intravitreal injections, antibiotics are not as effective at preventing this type of infection. Studies have demonstrated no difference between rates of infection with and without antibiotics when intravitreal injections are performed. There is evidence to suggest that a solution of povidone-iodine and antibiotics applied pre-injection may be effective at preventing some cases of endophthalmitis in people undergoing intravitreal injections. Intravenous antibiotics given prophylactically in those with penetrating eye trauma has shown a reduction in the incidence of exogenous endophthalmitis. Urgent medical attention is required if a person has suspected endophthalmitis. Intravitreal injection of antibiotics are indicated in bacterial endophthalmitis. Intravitreal injections of vancomycin (targeted against Gram-positive bacteria) and ceftazidime (targeting Gram-negative bacteria) are routine. Even though antibiotics can have negative impacts on the retina in high concentrations, since visual acuity worsens in 65% of endophthalmitis patients and prognosis gets poorer the longer an infection goes untreated, most medical professionals make the clinical judgment decision that immediate intervention with antibiotics is necessary. Fungal pathogens are treated with intravitreal injections of amphotericin B or voriconazole. Systemic antibiotics or anti-fungals are used in those with endogenous endophthalmitis with associated bacteremia or fungemia. People with endophthalmitis may also require an urgent surgery (pars plana vitrectomy). In some cases, evisceration may be necessary to remove a severe and intractable infection which could result in a blind and painful eye. In people with acute endophthalmitis, combined steroid treatment with antibiotics have been found to improve visual outcomes, versus patients only treated with antibiotics, but any improvements on the resolution acute endophthalmitis is unknown.","['eye pain', 'redness', 'swelling', 'blurred vision', 'decreased vision', 'floaters (dark spots or cobwebs in the vision)', 'increased sensitivity to light (photophobia)', 'discharge from the eye', 'excessive tearing', 'fever']","endophthalmitis eye pain, redness, swelling, blurred vision, decreased vision, floaters (dark spots or cobwebs in the vision), increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), discharge from the eye, excessive tearing, fever endophthalmitis, or endophthalmia, is inflammation of the interior cavity of the eye, usually caused by an infection. it is a possible complication of all intraocular surgeries, particularly cataract surgery, and can result in loss of vision or loss of the eye itself. infection can be caused by bacteria or fungi, and is classified as exogenous (infection introduced by direct inoculation as in surgery or penetrating trauma), or endogenous (organisms carried by blood vessels to the eye from another site of infection and is more common in people who have an immunocompromised state). different approaches have been suggested to prevent exogenous endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. perioperative antibiotic injections into the eye, specifically cefuroxime at the end of surgery, lowers the chance of endophthalmitis. moderate evidence also supports antibiotic eye drops (levofloxacin or chloramphenicol) with antibiotic injections (cefuroxime or penicillin) to reduce the risk of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery compared with injections or eye drops alone. periocular injection of penicillin along with chloramphenicol-suphadimidine eye drops and an intracameral cefuroxime injection with topical levofloxacin also reduces the risk reduction of developing endophthalmitis following cataract surgery for some people. for people undergoing intravitreal injections, antibiotics are not as effective at preventing this type of infection. studies have demonstrated no difference between rates of infection with and without antibiotics when intravitreal injections are performed. there is evidence to suggest that a solution of povidone-iodine and antibiotics applied pre-injection may be effective at preventing some cases of endophthalmitis in people undergoing intravitreal injections. intravenous antibiotics given prophylactically in those with penetrating eye trauma has shown a reduction in the incidence of exogenous endophthalmitis. urgent medical attention is required if a person has suspected endophthalmitis. intravitreal injection of antibiotics are indicated in bacterial endophthalmitis. intravitreal injections of vancomycin (targeted against gram-positive bacteria) and ceftazidime (targeting gram-negative bacteria) are routine. even though antibiotics can have negative impacts on the retina in high concentrations, since visual acuity worsens in 65 of endophthalmitis patients and prognosis gets poorer the longer an infection goes untreated, most medical professionals make the clinical judgment decision that immediate intervention with antibiotics is necessary. fungal pathogens are treated with intravitreal injections of amphotericin b or voriconazole. systemic antibiotics or anti-fungals are used in those with endogenous endophthalmitis with associated bacteremia or fungemia. people with endophthalmitis may also require an urgent surgery (pars plana vitrectomy). in some cases, evisceration may be necessary to remove a severe and intractable infection which could result in a blind and painful eye. in people with acute endophthalmitis, combined steroid treatment with antibiotics have been found to improve visual outcomes, versus patients only treated with antibiotics, but any improvements on the resolution acute endophthalmitis is unknown."

Enterobiasis,"Anal itching, especially at night, difficulty sleeping","Anal itching, especially at night, difficulty sleeping. Enterobius vermicularis pinworm infection.","Pinworm infection cannot be totally prevented under most circumstances. This is due to the prevalence of the parasite and the ease of transmission through soiled night clothes, airborne eggs, contaminated furniture, toys and other objects. Infection may occur in the highest strata of society, where hygiene and nutritional status are typically high. The stigma associated with pinworm infection is hence considered a possible over-emphasis. Counselling is sometimes needed for upset parents who have discovered their children are infected, as they may not realize how prevalent the infection is. Preventive action revolves around personal hygiene and the cleanliness of the living quarters. The rate of reinfection can be reduced through hygienic measures, and this is recommended especially in recurring cases. The main measures are keeping fingernails short, and washing and scrubbing hands and fingers carefully, especially after defecation and before meals. Showering every morning is also highly recommended to wash off any eggs that may be still lying on the skin. Under ideal conditions, bed covers, sleeping garments, and hand towels should be changed daily and clothes and linens should be washed in hot water and then be placed in a hot dryer in order to kill off any eggs. Children can wear gloves while asleep, and the bedroom floor should be kept clean. Regular disinfection of kitchen and bathroom surfaces will help to prevent spread as well. Food should be covered to limit contamination with dust-borne parasite eggs. It is not recommended to shake clothes and bed linen as the eggs may detach and spread or to share clothes and towels. Nail biting and sucking on fingers is also discouraged. Medication is the primary treatment for pinworm infection. However, reinfection is frequent regardless of the medication used. Total elimination of the parasite in a household may require repeated doses of medication for up to a year or more. Because the drugs kill the adult pinworms, but not the eggs, the first retreatment is recommended in two weeks. Also, if one household member spreads the eggs to another, it will be a matter of two or three weeks before those eggs become adult worms and thus amenable to treatment. Asymptomatic infections, often in small children, can serve as reservoirs of infection, and therefore the entire household should be treated regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. The benzimidazole compounds albendazole (brand names e.g., Albenza, Eskazole, Zentel and Andazol) and mebendazole (brand names e.g., Ovex, Vermox, Antiox and Pripsen) are the most effective. They work by inhibiting the microtubule function in the pinworm adults, causing glycogen depletion, thereby effectively starving the parasite. A single 100 milligram dose of mebendazole with one repetition after two weeks, is considered the safest, and is usually effective with cure rate of 96%. Mebendazole has no serious side effects, although abdominal pain and diarrhea have been reported. Pyrantel pamoate (also called pyrantel embonate, brand names e.g., Reese's Pinworm Medicine, Pin-X, Combantrin, Anthel, Helmintox, and Helmex) kills adult pinworms through neuromuscular blockade, and is considered as effective as the benzimidazole compounds and is used as a second-line medication. Pyrantel pamoate is available over the counter and does not require a prescription. Pinworms located in the genitourinary system (in this case, female genital area) may require other drug treatments.","['anal itching', 'especially at night', 'difficulty sleeping']","enterobiasis anal itching, especially at night, difficulty sleeping anal itching, especially at night, difficulty sleeping. enterobius vermicularis pinworm infection. pinworm infection cannot be totally prevented under most circumstances. this is due to the prevalence of the parasite and the ease of transmission through soiled night clothes, airborne eggs, contaminated furniture, toys and other objects. infection may occur in the highest strata of society, where hygiene and nutritional status are typically high. the stigma associated with pinworm infection is hence considered a possible over-emphasis. counselling is sometimes needed for upset parents who have discovered their children are infected, as they may not realize how prevalent the infection is. preventive action revolves around personal hygiene and the cleanliness of the living quarters. the rate of reinfection can be reduced through hygienic measures, and this is recommended especially in recurring cases. the main measures are keeping fingernails short, and washing and scrubbing hands and fingers carefully, especially after defecation and before meals. showering every morning is also highly recommended to wash off any eggs that may be still lying on the skin. under ideal conditions, bed covers, sleeping garments, and hand towels should be changed daily and clothes and linens should be washed in hot water and then be placed in a hot dryer in order to kill off any eggs. children can wear gloves while asleep, and the bedroom floor should be kept clean. regular disinfection of kitchen and bathroom surfaces will help to prevent spread as well. food should be covered to limit contamination with dust-borne parasite eggs. it is not recommended to shake clothes and bed linen as the eggs may detach and spread or to share clothes and towels. nail biting and sucking on fingers is also discouraged. medication is the primary treatment for pinworm infection. however, reinfection is frequent regardless of the medication used. total elimination of the parasite in a household may require repeated doses of medication for up to a year or more. because the drugs kill the adult pinworms, but not the eggs, the first retreatment is recommended in two weeks. also, if one household member spreads the eggs to another, it will be a matter of two or three weeks before those eggs become adult worms and thus amenable to treatment. asymptomatic infections, often in small children, can serve as reservoirs of infection, and therefore the entire household should be treated regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. the benzimidazole compounds albendazole (brand names e.g., albenza, eskazole, zentel and andazol) and mebendazole (brand names e.g., ovex, vermox, antiox and pripsen) are the most effective. they work by inhibiting the microtubule function in the pinworm adults, causing glycogen depletion, thereby effectively starving the parasite. a single 100 milligram dose of mebendazole with one repetition after two weeks, is considered the safest, and is usually effective with cure rate of 96 . mebendazole has no serious side effects, although abdominal pain and diarrhea have been reported. pyrantel pamoate (also called pyrantel embonate, brand names e.g., reese s pinworm medicine, pin-x, combantrin, anthel, helmintox, and helmex) kills adult pinworms through neuromuscular blockade, and is considered as effective as the benzimidazole compounds and is used as a second-line medication. pyrantel pamoate is available over the counter and does not require a prescription. pinworms located in the genitourinary system (in this case, female genital area) may require other drug treatments."

Epidermolysis Bullosa,"Fragile skin, blisters appear easily, wounds are difficult to heal","Fragile skin, blisters appear easily, wounds are difficult to heal. Genetic disorders of skin proteins.","Research has focused on changing the mixture of keratins produced in the skin. There are 54 known keratin genes—of which 28 belong to the type I intermediate filament genes and 26 to type II—which work as heterodimers. Many of these genes share substantial structural and functional similarity, but they are specialized to cell type and/or conditions under which they are normally produced. If the balance of production could be shifted away from the mutated, dysfunctional keratin gene toward an intact keratin gene, symptoms could be reduced. For example, sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, was found to reduce blistering in a mouse model to the point where affected pups could not be identified visually, when injected into pregnant mice (5 μmol/day = 0.9 mg) and applied topically to newborns (1 μmol/day = 0.2 mg in jojoba oil). As of 2008, clinical research at the University of Minnesota has explored allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for RD and junctional EB, treating a two-year-old child who is one of two brothers with EB. A second transplant has also been performed on the child's older brother. A Missouri boy has also successfully undergone the transplant, as well as a 5 year old boy from Alabama. So far there have been 12 successful transplants. Another transplant is scheduled for a California baby. A clinical trial is planned for 30 subjects. However, the immune suppression that bone marrow transplantation requires causes a risk of serious infections with large scale blisters and skin erosion. Indeed, at least four people have died in the course of either preparation for or institution of bone marrow transplantation for EB, out of only a small group of patients treated so far. The mechanism of action of this therapy is unclear as hematopoietic stem cells are not thought to contribute to epithelial lineages. Rather, it is speculated that cross-correction from tissue-resident graft-derived immune cells contributes to the observed clinical benefit. A pilot study performed in 2015 suggests that systemic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may promote increased wound healing in people with dystrophic EB. Transplanting skin derived from genetically modified stem cells onto the wound surfaces has been studied with a report of improvements in one person. A 2017 clinical trial with male RDEB (recessive dystrophic EB) patients conducted successful grafting of type VII gene corrected keratinocytes (COL7A1 gene correction using retrovirus transduction), without any serious adverse effects. Type VII collage formation was observed at the dermis-epidermis junction in significant amounts. A 2020 study demonstrated the safe allogenic grafting of acellular dermal matrix/scaffolds in EB patients without any observed infection or necrosis and instead noted fewer required dressing changes, promoted wound healing, pain reduction, and an overall improvement in the quality of life of the patients. In 2022, a pharmaceutical gel made out of birch bark extract from Betula pendula and Betula pubescens was approved by the European Union as a treatment for epidermolysis bullosa.","['fragile skin', 'blisters appear easily', 'wounds are difficult to heal']","epidermolysis bullosa fragile skin, blisters appear easily, wounds are difficult to heal fragile skin, blisters appear easily, wounds are difficult to heal. genetic disorders of skin proteins. research has focused on changing the mixture of keratins produced in the skin. there are 54 known keratin genes of which 28 belong to the type i intermediate filament genes and 26 to type ii which work as heterodimers. many of these genes share substantial structural and functional similarity, but they are specialized to cell type and/or conditions under which they are normally produced. if the balance of production could be shifted away from the mutated, dysfunctional keratin gene toward an intact keratin gene, symptoms could be reduced. for example, sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, was found to reduce blistering in a mouse model to the point where affected pups could not be identified visually, when injected into pregnant mice (5 mol/day 0.9 mg) and applied topically to newborns (1 mol/day 0.2 mg in jojoba oil). as of 2008, clinical research at the university of minnesota has explored allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for rd and junctional eb, treating a two-year-old child who is one of two brothers with eb. a second transplant has also been performed on the child s older brother. a missouri boy has also successfully undergone the transplant, as well as a 5 year old boy from alabama. so far there have been 12 successful transplants. another transplant is scheduled for a california baby. a clinical trial is planned for 30 subjects. however, the immune suppression that bone marrow transplantation requires causes a risk of serious infections with large scale blisters and skin erosion. indeed, at least four people have died in the course of either preparation for or institution of bone marrow transplantation for eb, out of only a small group of patients treated so far. the mechanism of action of this therapy is unclear as hematopoietic stem cells are not thought to contribute to epithelial lineages. rather, it is speculated that cross-correction from tissue-resident graft-derived immune cells contributes to the observed clinical benefit. a pilot study performed in 2015 suggests that systemic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) may promote increased wound healing in people with dystrophic eb. transplanting skin derived from genetically modified stem cells onto the wound surfaces has been studied with a report of improvements in one person. a 2017 clinical trial with male rdeb (recessive dystrophic eb) patients conducted successful grafting of type vii gene corrected keratinocytes (col7a1 gene correction using retrovirus transduction), without any serious adverse effects. type vii collage formation was observed at the dermis-epidermis junction in significant amounts. a 2020 study demonstrated the safe allogenic grafting of acellular dermal matrix/scaffolds in eb patients without any observed infection or necrosis and instead noted fewer required dressing changes, promoted wound healing, pain reduction, and an overall improvement in the quality of life of the patients. in 2022, a pharmaceutical gel made out of birch bark extract from betula pendula and betula pubescens was approved by the european union as a treatment for epidermolysis bullosa."
Epididymitis,"Scrotal pain, fever, swelling","Scrotal pain, fever, swelling. Epididymal infection due to bacteria/STD.","In both the acute and chronic forms, antibiotics are used if an infection is suspected. The treatment of choice is often azithromycin and cefixime to cover both gonorrhoeae and chlamydia. Fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended due to widespread resistance of gonorrhoeae to this class. Doxycycline may be used as an alternative to azithromycin. In chronic epididymitis, a four- to six-week course of antibiotics may be prescribed to ensure the complete eradication of any possible bacterial cause, especially the various chlamydiae. For cases caused by enteric organisms (such as E. coli), ofloxacin or levofloxacin are recommended. In children, fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are best avoided. Since bacteria that cause urinary tract infections are often the cause of epididymitis in children, co-trimoxazole or suited penicillins (for example, cephalexin) can be used. Household remedies such as elevation of the scrotum and cold compresses applied regularly to the scrotum may relieve the pain in acute cases. Painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs are often used for the treatment of both chronic and acute forms. Hospitalisation is indicated for severe cases, and check-ups can ensure the infection has cleared up. Surgical removal of the epididymis is rarely necessary, causes sterility, and only gives relief from pain in approximately 50% of cases. However, in acute suppurating epididymitis (acute epididymitis with a discharge of pus), an epididymotomy may be recommended; in refractory cases, a full epididymectomy may be required. In cases with unrelenting testicular pain, removal of the entire testicle—orchiectomy—may also be warranted. It is generally believed that most cases of chronic epididymitis will eventually ""burn out"" of the patient's system if left untreated, though this might take years or even decades.

Fat Embolism,"Respiratory distress, chest pain, confusion, petechial rash (small red or purple spots), neurological symptoms","Fat embolism syndrome occurs when fat enters the blood stream (fat embolism) and results in symptoms. Symptoms generally begin within a day. This may include a petechial rash, decreased level of consciousness, and shortness of breath.","For those treated conservatively with immobilisation of long bone fractures, the incidence of FES is 22%. Early operative fixation of long bone fractures can reduce the incidence of FES especially with the usage of internal fixation devices. Patients undergoing urgent fixation of long bone fractures has a rate of 7% of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when compared to those undergoing fixation after 24 hours (39% with ARDS). However, movement of the fracture ends of the long bones during the operative fixation can cause transient increase of fat emboli in the blood circulation. Cytokines are persistently elevated if the long bone fractures is treated conservatively using immobilisation. The cytokine levels would return to normal after operative fixation. Although ream nailing increases pressure in the medullary cavity of the long bones, it does not increase the rates of FES. Other methods such as drilling of holes in the bony cortex, lavaging bone marrow prior to fixation, and the use of tourniquets to prevent embolisation have not been shown to reduce the rates of FES. Corticosteroid therapy such as methylprednisolone (6 to 90 mg/kg) has been proposed for the treatment of FES, however, it is controversial. Corticosteroid can be used to limit free fatty acid levels, stabilising membranes, and inhibit leukocyte aggregation. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 reported prophylactic corticosteroids can reduce the risk of FES by 77%. However, there is no difference in mortality, infection, and avascular necrosis when compared to the control group. However, a randomised trial conducted in 2004 reported no differences in FES incidence when comparing treatment with the control group. Administration of corticosteroids for 2 to 3 days is not associated with increased rates of infection. However, there is insufficient data to support the use of methyprednisolone once FES is established. Heparin has been used in the prevention of venous thrombosis in post-operative patients; however its regular use in those with FES has been contraindicated due to increase risk of bleeding in those with polytrauma. Placement of inferior vena cava filters has been proposed to reduce the amount of emboli going into the lung vascular system, however, this method has not been studied in detail. Once FES develops, the person should be admitted into intensive care unit (ICU), preferably with central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. CVP monitoring would be helpful to guide the volume resuscitation. Supportive treatment is the only proven treatment method. Supplemental oxygen can be given if a person has mild respiratory distress. However, if a person has severe respiratory distress, either continuous positive pressure ventilation (CPAP), or mechanical ventilation using positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be indicated. Fluid replacement is required to prevent shock. Volume resuscitation with human albumin is recommended because it can restore blood volume in the circulatory system while also binds to free fatty acids in order to reduce lung injuries. In severe cases, dobutamine should be used to support the right ventricular failure. Frequent Glasgow coma scale (GCS) charting is required to assess the neurological progression of a person with FES. A placement of intracranial pressure monitor may be helpful to direct the treatment of cerebral odema.","['respiratory distress', 'chest pain', 'confusion', 'petechial rash (small red or purple spots)', 'neurological symptoms']","fat embolism respiratory distress, chest pain, confusion, petechial rash (small red or purple spots), neurological symptoms fat embolism syndrome occurs when fat enters the blood stream (fat embolism) and results in symptoms. symptoms generally begin within a day. this may include a petechial rash, decreased level of consciousness, and shortness of breath. for those treated conservatively with immobilisation of long bone fractures, the incidence of fes is 22 . early operative fixation of long bone fractures can reduce the incidence of fes especially with the usage of internal fixation devices. patients undergoing urgent fixation of long bone fractures has a rate of 7 of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) when compared to those undergoing fixation after 24 hours (39 with ards). however, movement of the fracture ends of the long bones during the operative fixation can cause transient increase of fat emboli in the blood circulation. cytokines are persistently elevated if the long bone fractures is treated conservatively using immobilisation. the cytokine levels would return to normal after operative fixation. although ream nailing increases pressure in the medullary cavity of the long bones, it does not increase the rates of fes. other methods such as drilling of holes in the bony cortex, lavaging bone marrow prior to fixation, and the use of tourniquets to prevent embolisation have not been shown to reduce the rates of fes. corticosteroid therapy such as methylprednisolone (6 to 90 mg/kg) has been proposed for the treatment of fes, however, it is controversial. corticosteroid can be used to limit free fatty acid levels, stabilising membranes, and inhibit leukocyte aggregation. a meta-analysis conducted in 2009 reported prophylactic corticosteroids can reduce the risk of fes by 77 . however, there is no difference in mortality, infection, and avascular necrosis when compared to the control group. however, a randomised trial conducted in 2004 reported no differences in fes incidence when comparing treatment with the control group. administration of corticosteroids for 2 to 3 days is not associated with increased rates of infection. however, there is insufficient data to support the use of methyprednisolone once fes is established. heparin has been used in the prevention of venous thrombosis in post-operative patients however its regular use in those with fes has been contraindicated due to increase risk of bleeding in those with polytrauma. placement of inferior vena cava filters has been proposed to reduce the amount of emboli going into the lung vascular system, however, this method has not been studied in detail. once fes develops, the person should be admitted into intensive care unit (icu), preferably with central venous pressure (cvp) monitoring. cvp monitoring would be helpful to guide the volume resuscitation. supportive treatment is the only proven treatment method. supplemental oxygen can be given if a person has mild respiratory distress. however, if a person has severe respiratory distress, either continuous positive pressure ventilation (cpap), or mechanical ventilation using positive end-expiratory pressure (peep) may be indicated. fluid replacement is required to prevent shock. volume resuscitation with human albumin is recommended because it can restore blood volume in the circulatory system while also binds to free fatty acids in order to reduce lung injuries. in severe cases, dobutamine should be used to support the right ventricular failure. frequent glasgow coma scale (gcs) charting is required to assess the neurological progression of a person with fes. a placement of intracranial pressure monitor may be helpful to direct the treatment of cerebral odema."

Food Allergy,"Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, gastrointestinal symptoms","A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to food. The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure.","Breastfeeding for more than four months may prevent atopic dermatitis, cow's milk allergy, and wheezing in early childhood. Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective. Specifically, early exposure to eggs and peanuts reduces the risk of allergies to these. Guidelines suggest introducing peanuts as early as 4–6 months and include precautionary measures for high-risk infants. The former guidelines, advising delaying the introduction of peanuts, are now thought to have contributed to the increase in peanut allergy seen recently. To avoid an allergic reaction, a strict diet can be followed. It is difficult to determine the amount of allergenic food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted. In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens through skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, blood transfusions, cosmetics, and alcohol. Early introduction of peanut and egg alongside other solids, or by one year of age, may help prevent development of food allergy. Introduction of these allergenic foods within the first year of life appears to be safe. A window of opportunity for the introduction of different food allergens may exist, such as egg introduction ahead of peanut. The mainstay of treatment for food allergy is total avoidance of the foods identified as allergens. An allergen can enter the body by consuming a portion of food containing the allergen, and can also be ingested by touching any surfaces that may have come into contact with the allergen, then touching the eyes or nose. For people who are extremely sensitive, avoidance includes avoiding touching or inhaling problematic food. Total avoidance is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see regulation of labelling). If the food is accidentally ingested and a systemic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs, then epinephrine should be used. A second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions. The person should then be transported to the emergency room, where additional treatment can be given.

A 2015 review found that when done during pregnancy moderate physical exercise is effective for the prevention of gestational diabetes. A 2014 review, however, did not find a significant effect. It is uncertain if additional dietary advice interventions help to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. However, data from the Nurses' Health Study shows that adherence to a healthy plant-based diet is associated with lower risk for GDM. Diet and physical activity interventions designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain reduce the rates of gestational diabetes. However, the impact of these interventions varies with the body mass index of the person as well as with the region in which the studies were performed. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that there is a reduced risk of gestational diabetes mellitus and caesarean section with combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy, as well as reductions in gestational weight gain, compared with standard care. There is no clear evidence that taking metformin while pregnant reduces the risk of developing gestational diabetes, though some evidence has associated its use with reduced maternal weight gain during pregnancy. A 2023 review found that a plant-based diet (including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and tea) rich in phytochemicals lowers the risk of GDM. A Cochrane review, updated 2023, stated that myo‐inositol has a potential beneficial effect of improving insulin sensitivity, which suggested that it may be useful for women in preventing gestational diabetes″. It has been suggested that for women who have had gestational diabetes, diet, exercise, education, and lifestyle changes between pregnancies may lower their chances of having gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies. For women with a normal BMI pre-pregnancy, light to moderate exercise for 30-60 minutes three times a week during pregnancy can decrease the occurrence of GDM. It was found that women who completed at least 600 MET-min/week of moderate intensity exercise can cause at least a 25% reduction in the odds of developing GDM. When studying the difference effects between aerobic and resistance training, it was found that there were no differences in fasting blood glucose levels, insulin utilization rate, or pregnancy outcomes. However, there was an better improvement in the 2-hour postprandial blood glucose level. The resistance training group was also more compliant with their workout program than the aerobic group. Based on this information, resistance training may be a better option for women with gestational diabetes, but doing both aerobic training and resistance training would be optimal. Treatment of GDM with diet and insulin reduces health problems for the mother and child. Treatment of GDM is also accompanied by more inductions of labour. A repeat OGTT should be carried out 6 weeks after delivery, to confirm that diabetes has disappeared. Afterwards, regular screening for type 2 diabetes is advised. Lifestyle interventions include exercise, diet advice, behavioural interventions, relaxation, self-monitoring of glucose, and combined interventions. Women with gestational diabetes who receive lifestyle interventions seem to have less postpartum depression, and were more likely to reach their weight loss targets after giving birth, than women who had no intervention. Their babies are also less likely to be large for their gestational age, and have less percentage of fat when they are born. More research is needed to discover the most effective lifestyle interventions. Some women with GDM use probiotics, but it is very uncertain if there are any benefits in terms of blood glucose levels, high blood pressure disorders, or induction of labour. If a diabetic diet or G.I. Diet, exercise, and oral medication are inadequate to control glucose levels, insulin therapy may become necessary. The development of macrosomia can be evaluated during pregnancy by using sonography. Women who use insulin, with a history of stillbirth, or with hypertension are managed like women with overt diabetes. Researchers have found ways for pregnant women with gestational diabetes to reduce their complications with their current health, long-term effects, and fetal health with the help of exercise. Laredo-Aguilera, et al., and Dipla, et al., presented findings from systematic and meta-analyses that showed positive effects of resistance exercise or a combination of resistance and aerobic exercise. Aerobic and resistance training were found to control glucose, HgbA1c, and insulin levels in women with GDM. Not only is the mother's health affected, but also the fetus's. If GDM is not treated or is made worse, the child may suffer from macrosomia, impaired intrauterine growth, obstetric trauma, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, or even infection. Pregnant women with GDM who are overweight or obese are at a greater risk of passing down these negative effects by 2.14-3.56 times. Benefits to resistance and aerobic exercise include a maternal decrease in cramps, lower back pain, edema, depression, urinary incontinence, duration of labor, constipation, and the number of c-sections. These benefits can affect the fetus by having a decreased body fat mass, improved stress tolerance, and advanced neurobehavioral maturation. In the article written by Laredo-Aguilera, et al., there were seven interventions and seven different countries that were used for research. Within all of the interventions, there were significant improvements in glucose concentration, reduced requirements of insulin injections, postprandial glucose level control, and glycemic control. The study reviewed by Dipla, et al., found that even a single exercise bout increases skeletal muscle glucose uptake, minimizing hyperglycemia. Regular exercise training has been found to promote mitochondrial biogenesis, improve oxidative capacity, enhance insulin sensitivity and vascular function, and reduce systemic inflammation in women with GDM. Women with GDM must provide enough glucose to the fetus, but often become insulin resistant.

Gestational Hypertension,High blood pressure without proteinuria (preeclampsia),Gestational hypertension or pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is the development of new hypertension in a pregnant woman after 20 weeks of gestation without the presence of protein in the urine or other signs of pre-eclampsia. Gestational hypertension is defined as having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 on two occasions at least 6 hours apart. == Signs and symptoms == No single diagnostic test currently exists to predict the likelihood of developing gestational hypertension.,"There is no specific treatment, but gestational hypertension is monitored closely to rapidly identify pre-eclampsia and its life-threatening complications (HELLP syndrome and eclampsia). Drug treatment options are limited, as many antihypertensives may negatively affect the fetus. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy as they are teratogenic. Methyldopa, hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol are most commonly used for severe pregnancy hypertension. The fetus is at increased risk for a variety of life-threatening conditions, including pulmonary hypoplasia (immature lungs). If dangerous complications appear after the fetus has reached a point of viability, even though still immature, then an early delivery may be warranted to save the lives of both mother and baby. An appropriate plan for labor and delivery includes the selection of a hospital with provisions for advanced life support for newborn babies. Exercise during pregnancy can help prevent hypertension as it can improve not only the health of the mother but also the child. Exercise can regulate the energy needs required during pregnancy while also decreasing inflammation. Regular exercise can also lower the stress levels associated with pregnancy. There have been significant findings on how exercising can help reduce the effects of hypertension just after one bout of exercise. Exercising can help reduce hypertension as well as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. There have been findings in recent studies suggesting that exercising according to recommended guidelines during pregnancy can reduce the risk of developing gestational hypertensive disorder by 30%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that during pregnancy, the pregnant woman should exercise 150 minutes each week, specifically focusing on aerobic activity at a moderate intensity. The acute physiological responses include increased cardiac output (CO) of the individual (increased heart rate and stroke volume). This increase in CO can inadvertently maintain the amount of blood going into the muscles, improving the muscle's functionality later. Exercising can also improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure, making it easier for blood to pump to the body. Through regular bouts of physical activity, blood pressure can be reduced, thereby reducing the incidence of hypertension. A recent meta-analysis presented that exercise interventions in pregnant women could reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The meta-analysis study found that exercise is more likely to reduce the risk of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in women who are more prone to developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Risk factors that influence the likelihood of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include, a maternal age of 40 or more, pre-pregnancy obesity, excess weight gain during pregnancy and gestational diabetes. Aerobic exercise has been shown to regulate blood pressure more effectively than resistance training. Compared to having a sedentary lifestyle, being physically active in aerobic exercise for 30-60 minutes 2-7 times a week significantly decreases the risk of gestational hypertension in pregnancy compared to a sedentary pregnant individual. It is recommended to see the effects of exercising; a person should aim for 5-7 days/ week of aerobic exercise. This exercise should be light to moderate intensity, up to ~85% of max heart rate (220-age). Aerobic exercise can decrease SBP by 5- 15 mmHg, versus resistance training, which decreases it by 3- 5 mmHg. Aerobic exercises such as jogging, rowing, dancing, or hiking can decrease SBP the most. The decrease in SBP can regulate the effect of hypertension, ensuring the baby will not be harmed. Resistance training takes a toll on the cardiovascular system in untrained individuals, leading to a reluctance to prescribe resistance training to reduce blood pressure.",['high blood pressure without proteinuria (preeclampsia)'],"gestational hypertension high blood pressure without proteinuria (preeclampsia) gestational hypertension or pregnancy-induced hypertension (pih) is the development of new hypertension in a pregnant woman after 20 weeks of gestation without the presence of protein in the urine or other signs of pre-eclampsia. gestational hypertension is defined as having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 on two occasions at least 6 hours apart. signs and symptoms no single diagnostic test currently exists to predict the likelihood of developing gestational hypertension. there is no specific treatment, but gestational hypertension is monitored closely to rapidly identify pre-eclampsia and its life-threatening complications (hellp syndrome and eclampsia). drug treatment options are limited, as many antihypertensives may negatively affect the fetus. ace inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy as they are teratogenic. methyldopa, hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol are most commonly used for severe pregnancy hypertension. the fetus is at increased risk for a variety of life-threatening conditions, including pulmonary hypoplasia (immature lungs). if dangerous complications appear after the fetus has reached a point of viability, even though still immature, then an early delivery may be warranted to save the lives of both mother and baby. an appropriate plan for labor and delivery includes the selection of a hospital with provisions for advanced life support for newborn babies. exercise during pregnancy can help prevent hypertension as it can improve not only the health of the mother but also the child. exercise can regulate the energy needs required during pregnancy while also decreasing inflammation. regular exercise can also lower the stress levels associated with pregnancy. there have been significant findings on how exercising can help reduce the effects of hypertension just after one bout of exercise. exercising can help reduce hypertension as well as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. there have been findings in recent studies suggesting that exercising according to recommended guidelines during pregnancy can reduce the risk of developing gestational hypertensive disorder by 30 . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends that during pregnancy, the pregnant woman should exercise 150 minutes each week, specifically focusing on aerobic activity at a moderate intensity. the acute physiological responses include increased cardiac output (co) of the individual (increased heart rate and stroke volume). this increase in co can inadvertently maintain the amount of blood going into the muscles, improving the muscle s functionality later. exercising can also improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure, making it easier for blood to pump to the body. through regular bouts of physical activity, blood pressure can be reduced, thereby reducing the incidence of hypertension. a recent meta-analysis presented that exercise interventions in pregnant women could reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure. the meta-analysis study found that exercise is more likely to reduce the risk of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in women who are more prone to developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. risk factors that influence the likelihood of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include, a maternal age of 40 or more, pre-pregnancy obesity, excess weight gain during pregnancy and gestational diabetes. aerobic exercise has been shown to regulate blood pressure more effectively than resistance training. compared to having a sedentary lifestyle, being physically active in aerobic exercise for 30-60 minutes 2-7 times a week significantly decreases the risk of gestational hypertension in pregnancy compared to a sedentary pregnant individual. it is recommended to see the effects of exercising a person should aim for 5-7 days/ week of aerobic exercise. this exercise should be light to moderate intensity, up to 85 of max heart rate (220-age). aerobic exercise can decrease sbp by 5- 15 mmhg, versus resistance training, which decreases it by 3- 5 mmhg. aerobic exercises such as jogging, rowing, dancing, or hiking can decrease sbp the most. the decrease in sbp can regulate the effect of hypertension, ensuring the baby will not be harmed. resistance training takes a toll on the cardiovascular system in untrained individuals, leading to a reluctance to prescribe resistance training to reduce blood pressure."
Giardiasis,"Watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, weakness","Watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, weakness. Infeksi protozoa Giardia lamblia melalui air/ makanan tercemar.","The CDC recommends hand-washing and avoiding potentially contaminated food and untreated water. Boiling water contaminated with Giardia effectively kills infectious cysts. Chemical disinfectants or filters may be used. Iodine-based disinfectants are preferred over chlorination as the latter is ineffective at destroying cysts. Although the evidence linking the drinking of water in the North American wilderness and giardiasis has been questioned, several studies raise concerns. Most if not all CDC verified backcountry giardiasis outbreaks have been attributed to water. Surveillance data (for 2013 and 2014) reports six outbreaks (96 cases) of waterborne giardiasis contracted from rivers, streams or springs and less than 1% of reported giardiasis cases are associated with outbreaks. Person-to-person transmission accounts for the majority of Giardia infections and is usually associated with poor hygiene and sanitation. Giardia is often found on the surface of the ground, in the soil, in undercooked foods, and in water, and on hands that have not been properly cleaned after handling infected faeces. Water-borne transmission is associated with the ingestion of contaminated water. In the U.S., outbreaks typically occur in small water systems using inadequately treated surface water. Venereal transmission happens through faecal-oral contamination. Additionally, nappy/diaper changing and inadequate handwashing are risk factors for transmission from infected children. Lastly, food-borne epidemics of Giardia have developed through the contamination of food by infected food handlers. Treatment is not always necessary as the infection usually resolves on its own. However, if the illness is acute or symptoms persist and medications are needed to treat it, a nitroimidazole medication is used such as metronidazole, tinidazole, secnidazole or ornidazole. The World Health Organisation and Infectious Disease Society of America recommend metronidazole as first-line therapy. The US CDC lists metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide as effective first-line therapies; of these three, only nitazoxanide and tinidazole are approved for the treatment of giardiasis by the US FDA. A meta-analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration in 2012 found that compared to the standard of metronidazole, albendazole had equivalent efficacy while having fewer side effects, such as gastrointestinal or neurologic issues. Other meta-analyses have reached similar conclusions. Both medications need a five to ten-day-long course; albendazole is taken once a day, while metronidazole needs to be taken three times a day. The evidence for comparing metronidazole to other alternatives such as mebendazole, tinidazole, or nitazoxanide was felt to be of very low quality. While tinidazole has side effects and efficacy similar to those of metronidazole, it is administered with a single dose. Resistance has been observed clinically to both nitroimidazoles and albendazole, but not nitazoxanide, though nitazoxanide resistance has been induced in research laboratories. The exact mechanism of resistance to all of these medications is not well understood. In the case of nitroimidazole-resistant strains of Giardia, other drugs are available which have shown efficacy in treatment including quinacrine, nitazoxanide, bacitracin zinc, furazolidone and paromomycin. Mepacrine may also be used for refractory cases. Probiotics, when given in combination with the standard treatment, have been shown to assist with clearance of Giardia. During pregnancy, paromomycin is the preferred treatment drug because of its poor intestinal absorption, resulting in less exposure to the foetus. Alternatively, metronidazole can be used after the first trimester as there has been wide experience in its use for trichomonas in pregnancy.","['watery diarrhea', 'stomach cramps', 'nausea', 'weakness']","giardiasis watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, weakness watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, weakness. infeksi protozoa giardia lamblia melalui air/ makanan tercemar. the cdc recommends hand-washing and avoiding potentially contaminated food and untreated water. boiling water contaminated with giardia effectively kills infectious cysts. chemical disinfectants or filters may be used. iodine-based disinfectants are preferred over chlorination as the latter is ineffective at destroying cysts. although the evidence linking the drinking of water in the north american wilderness and giardiasis has been questioned, several studies raise concerns. most if not all cdc verified backcountry giardiasis outbreaks have been attributed to water. surveillance data (for 2013 and 2014) reports six outbreaks (96 cases) of waterborne giardiasis contracted from rivers, streams or springs and less than 1 of reported giardiasis cases are associated with outbreaks. person-to-person transmission accounts for the majority of giardia infections and is usually associated with poor hygiene and sanitation. giardia is often found on the surface of the ground, in the soil, in undercooked foods, and in water, and on hands that have not been properly cleaned after handling infected faeces. water-borne transmission is associated with the ingestion of contaminated water. in the u.s., outbreaks typically occur in small water systems using inadequately treated surface water. venereal transmission happens through faecal-oral contamination. additionally, nappy/diaper changing and inadequate handwashing are risk factors for transmission from infected children. lastly, food-borne epidemics of giardia have developed through the contamination of food by infected food handlers. treatment is not always necessary as the infection usually resolves on its own. however, if the illness is acute or symptoms persist and medications are needed to treat it, a nitroimidazole medication is used such as metronidazole, tinidazole, secnidazole or ornidazole. the world health organisation and infectious disease society of america recommend metronidazole as first-line therapy. the us cdc lists metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide as effective first-line therapies of these three, only nitazoxanide and tinidazole are approved for the treatment of giardiasis by the us fda. a meta-analysis published by the cochrane collaboration in 2012 found that compared to the standard of metronidazole, albendazole had equivalent efficacy while having fewer side effects, such as gastrointestinal or neurologic issues. other meta-analyses have reached similar conclusions. both medications need a five to ten-day-long course albendazole is taken once a day, while metronidazole needs to be taken three times a day. the evidence for comparing metronidazole to other alternatives such as mebendazole, tinidazole, or nitazoxanide was felt to be of very low quality. while tinidazole has side effects and efficacy similar to those of metronidazole, it is administered with a single dose. resistance has been observed clinically to both nitroimidazoles and albendazole, but not nitazoxanide, though nitazoxanide resistance has been induced in research laboratories. the exact mechanism of resistance to all of these medications is not well understood. in the case of nitroimidazole-resistant strains of giardia, other drugs are available which have shown efficacy in treatment including quinacrine, nitazoxanide, bacitracin zinc, furazolidone and paromomycin. mepacrine may also be used for refractory cases. probiotics, when given in combination with the standard treatment, have been shown to assist with clearance of giardia. during pregnancy, paromomycin is the preferred treatment drug because of its poor intestinal absorption, resulting in less exposure to the foetus. alternatively, metronidazole can be used after the first trimester as there has been wide experience in its use for trichomonas in pregnancy."

Regular dental check-ups and professional teeth cleaning as required: Dental check-ups serve to monitor the person's oral hygiene methods and levels of attachment around teeth, identify any early signs of periodontitis, and monitor response to treatment. Typically, dental hygienists (or dentists) use special instruments to clean (debride) teeth below the gumline and disrupt any plaque growing below the gumline. This is a standard treatment to prevent any further progression of established periodontitis. Studies show that after such a professional cleaning (periodontal debridement), microbial plaque tends to regrow to precleaning levels after about three to four months. Nonetheless, the continued stabilization of a person's periodontal state depends largely, if not primarily, on the person's oral hygiene at home, as well as on the go. Without daily oral hygiene, periodontal disease will not be overcome, especially if the person has a history of extensive periodontal disease. The cornerstone of successful periodontal treatment starts with establishing excellent oral hygiene. This includes twice-daily brushing with daily flossing. Also, the use of an interdental brush is helpful if the space between the teeth allows. For smaller spaces, products such as narrow picks with soft rubber bristles provide excellent manual cleaning. Persons with dexterity problems, such as with arthritis, may find oral hygiene to be difficult and may require more frequent professional care and/or the use of a powered toothbrush.

Head and Neck Cancer,"Persistent sore throat, difficulty swallowing, voice changes, ear pain, neck mass, weight loss","Head and neck cancer is a general term encompassing multiple cancers that can develop in the head and neck region. These include cancers of the mouth, tongue, gums and lips (oral cancer), voice box (laryngeal), throat (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal), salivary glands, nose and sinuses. Head and neck cancer can present a wide range of symptoms depending on where the cancer developed.","Avoidance of risk factors (such as smoking and alcohol) is the single most effective form of prevention. Regular dental examinations may identify pre-cancerous lesions in the oral cavity. While screening in the general population does not appear to be useful, screening high-risk groups by examination of the throat might be useful. Head and neck cancer is often curable if it is diagnosed early; however, outcomes are typically poor if it is diagnosed late. When diagnosed early, oral, head, and neck cancers can be treated more easily, and the chances of survival increase tremendously. The HPV vaccine helps to prevent the development of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer. Improvements in diagnosis and local management, as well as targeted therapy, have led to improvements in quality of life and survival for people with head and neck cancer. After a histologic diagnosis has been established and tumor extent determined, such as with the use of PET-CT, the selection of appropriate treatment for a specific cancer depends on a complex array of variables, including tumor site, relative morbidity of various treatment options, concomitant health problems, social and logistic factors, previous primary tumors, and the person's preference. Treatment planning generally requires a multidisciplinary approach involving specialist surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. Surgical resection and radiation therapy are the mainstays of treatment for most head and neck cancers and remain the standard of care in most cases. For small primary cancers without regional metastases (stage I or II), wide surgical excision alone or curative radiation therapy alone is used. For more extensive primary tumors or those with regional metastases (stage III or IV), planned combinations of pre- or postoperative radiation and complete surgical excision are generally used. More recently, as historical survival and control rates have been recognized as less than satisfactory, there has been an emphasis on the use of various induction or concomitant chemotherapy regimens.","['persistent sore throat', 'difficulty swallowing', 'voice changes', 'ear pain', 'neck mass', 'weight loss']","head and neck cancer persistent sore throat, difficulty swallowing, voice changes, ear pain, neck mass, weight loss head and neck cancer is a general term encompassing multiple cancers that can develop in the head and neck region. these include cancers of the mouth, tongue, gums and lips (oral cancer), voice box (laryngeal), throat (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal), salivary glands, nose and sinuses. head and neck cancer can present a wide range of symptoms depending on where the cancer developed. avoidance of risk factors (such as smoking and alcohol) is the single most effective form of prevention. regular dental examinations may identify pre-cancerous lesions in the oral cavity. while screening in the general population does not appear to be useful, screening high-risk groups by examination of the throat might be useful. head and neck cancer is often curable if it is diagnosed early however, outcomes are typically poor if it is diagnosed late. when diagnosed early, oral, head, and neck cancers can be treated more easily, and the chances of survival increase tremendously. the hpv vaccine helps to prevent the development of hpv-related oropharyngeal cancer. improvements in diagnosis and local management, as well as targeted therapy, have led to improvements in quality of life and survival for people with head and neck cancer. after a histologic diagnosis has been established and tumor extent determined, such as with the use of pet-ct, the selection of appropriate treatment for a specific cancer depends on a complex array of variables, including tumor site, relative morbidity of various treatment options, concomitant health problems, social and logistic factors, previous primary tumors, and the person s preference. treatment planning generally requires a multidisciplinary approach involving specialist surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. surgical resection and radiation therapy are the mainstays of treatment for most head and neck cancers and remain the standard of care in most cases. for small primary cancers without regional metastases (stage i or ii), wide surgical excision alone or curative radiation therapy alone is used. for more extensive primary tumors or those with regional metastases (stage iii or iv), planned combinations of pre- or postoperative radiation and complete surgical excision are generally used. more recently, as historical survival and control rates have been recognized as less than satisfactory, there has been an emphasis on the use of various induction or concomitant chemotherapy regimens."

Aktivasi berlebihan sistem imun.","HLH is a description of an immunophysiologic state in time. It can be dangerous to infer a genetic impairment of granule-mediated cytotoxicity in patients, especially older children and adults, who meet any of the various criteria for HLH. Thus, like shock, one must simultaneously manage both the acute physiologic changes associated with HLH (like systemic inflammation, DIC, hepatitis, etc.) and look deeply for various underlying contributors. The International Histiocyte Society has collected the published consensus management documents for the many contexts in which HLH occurs and they host full-text versions. Most patients who meet HLH criteria will have secondary cases. Treatment for these patients should focus on the underlying contributors. Additionally, treatment of the inflammation of HLH itself is often required. While optimal treatment of HLH is still being debated, current treatment regimes usually involve high dose corticosteroids, etoposide and cyclosporin. Intravenous immunoglobulin is also used. Methotrexate and vincristine have also been used. However, for secondary HLH, evidence suggests that the benefit of etoposide-based therapy is limited, as it may mask or delay diagnosis of the underlying contributors and increase risk of toxicity. Cytokine targeted therapy, which is less toxic, could be a more rational approach to treat inflammation while not interfering with the identification of underlying causes of secondary HLH. On 20 November 2018, the FDA approved the anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody emapalumab (proprietary name Gamifant) for the treatment of pediatric and adult primary HLH. In October 2021 NHS England published Clinical Commissioning Policy: Anakinra for Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) for adults and children in all ages, allowing Anakinra (a modified recombinant interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) to be used in the treatment of HLH.

Early antiviral treatment may be required in fewer than 1% of people, whose infection takes a very aggressive course (fulminant hepatitis) or who are immunocompromised. On the other hand, treatment of chronic infection may be necessary to reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronically infected individuals with persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, and HBV DNA levels are candidates for therapy. Treatment lasts from six months to a year, depending on medication and genotype. Treatment duration when medication is taken by mouth, however, is more variable and usually longer than one year. Although none of the available medications can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2024, there are seven medications licensed for the treatment of hepatitis B infection in the United States. These include antiviral medications lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, telbivudine, and entecavir, and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and PEGylated interferon alpha-2a. In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended tenofovir or entecavir as first-line agents. Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment. The use of interferon, which requires injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals are much more likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D. It seems unlikely that the disease will be eliminated by 2030, the goal set in 2016 by WHO. However, progress is being made in developing therapeutic treatments. In 2010, the Hepatitis B Foundation reported that 3 preclinical and 11 clinical-stage drugs were under development, based on largely similar mechanisms. In 2020, they reported that there were 17 preclinical- and 32 clinical-stage drugs under development, using diverse mechanisms.","['abdominal pain', 'dark urine', 'yellow skin']","hepatitis b abdominal pain, dark urine, yellow skin abdominal pain, dark urine, yellow skin. hepatitis b is an infection of your liver. it can cause scarring of the organ, liver failure, and cancer. it can be fatal if it isn t treated. it s spread when people come in contact with the blood, open sores, or body fluids of someone who has the hepatitis b virus. acute hepatitis b infection does not usually require treatment and most adults clear the infection spontaneously. early antiviral treatment may be required in fewer than 1 of people, whose infection takes a very aggressive course (fulminant hepatitis) or who are immunocompromised. on the other hand, treatment of chronic infection may be necessary to reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. chronically infected individuals with persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, and hbv dna levels are candidates for therapy. treatment lasts from six months to a year, depending on medication and genotype. treatment duration when medication is taken by mouth, however, is more variable and usually longer than one year. although none of the available medications can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. as of 2024, there are seven medications licensed for the treatment of hepatitis b infection in the united states. these include antiviral medications lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, telbivudine, and entecavir, and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and pegylated interferon alpha-2a. in 2015, the world health organization recommended tenofovir or entecavir as first-line agents. those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment. the use of interferon, which requires injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting pegylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. however, some individuals are much more likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person s heredity. the treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). response to treatment differs between the genotypes. interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37 in genotype a but only a 6 seroconversion in type d. genotype b has similar seroconversion rates to type a while type c seroconverts only in 15 of cases. sustained e antigen loss after treatment is 45 in types a and b but only 25 30 in types c and d. it seems unlikely that the disease will be eliminated by 2030, the goal set in 2016 by who. however, progress is being made in developing therapeutic treatments. in 2010, the hepatitis b foundation reported that 3 preclinical and 11 clinical-stage drugs were under development, based on largely similar mechanisms. in 2020, they reported that there were 17 preclinical- and 32 clinical-stage drugs under development, using diverse mechanisms."
Hepatitis C,"Yellow eyes, tired easily, stomach ache","Yellow eyes, tired easily, stomach ache. Inflammation of the liver due to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is usually spread via blood transfusion (rare), hemodialysis, and needle sticks. The damage hepatitis C does to the liver can lead to cirrhosis and its complications as well as cancer.","As of 2022, no approved vaccine protects against contracting hepatitis C. A combination of harm reduction strategies, such as the provision of new needles and syringes and treatment of substance use, decreases the risk of hepatitis C in people using injection drugs by about 75%. The screening of blood donors is important at a national level, as is adhering to universal precautions within healthcare facilities. In countries where there is an insufficient supply of sterile syringes, medications should be given orally rather than via injection (when possible). Recent research also suggests that treating people with active infection, thereby reducing the potential for transmission, may be an effective preventive measure. Hepatitis C vaccine phase 1 clinical trials are set to begin in the summer of 2023. Those with chronic hepatitis C are advised to avoid alcohol and medications that are toxic to the liver. They should also be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B due to the increased risk if also infected. Use of acetaminophen is generally considered safe at reduced doses. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended in those with advanced liver disease due to an increased risk of bleeding. Ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is recommended in those with accompanying cirrhosis. Regular, moderate coffee consumption, especially caffeinated, has been associated with a slower rate of liver scarring in those infected with HCV.","['yellow eyes', 'tired easily', 'stomach ache']","hepatitis c yellow eyes, tired easily, stomach ache yellow eyes, tired easily, stomach ache. inflammation of the liver due to the hepatitis c virus (hcv), which is usually spread via blood transfusion (rare), hemodialysis, and needle sticks. the damage hepatitis c does to the liver can lead to cirrhosis and its complications as well as cancer. as of 2022, no approved vaccine protects against contracting hepatitis c. a combination of harm reduction strategies, such as the provision of new needles and syringes and treatment of substance use, decreases the risk of hepatitis c in people using injection drugs by about 75 . the screening of blood donors is important at a national level, as is adhering to universal precautions within healthcare facilities. in countries where there is an insufficient supply of sterile syringes, medications should be given orally rather than via injection (when possible). recent research also suggests that treating people with active infection, thereby reducing the potential for transmission, may be an effective preventive measure. hepatitis c vaccine phase 1 clinical trials are set to begin in the summer of 2023. those with chronic hepatitis c are advised to avoid alcohol and medications that are toxic to the liver. they should also be vaccinated against hepatitis a and hepatitis b due to the increased risk if also infected. use of acetaminophen is generally considered safe at reduced doses. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are not recommended in those with advanced liver disease due to an increased risk of bleeding. ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is recommended in those with accompanying cirrhosis. regular, moderate coffee consumption, especially caffeinated, has been associated with a slower rate of liver scarring in those infected with hcv."
Hepatitis D,"Yellow eyes, nausea, weakness, stomach pain","Yellow eyes, nausea, weakness, stomach pain. Hepatitis D, also known as the hepatitis delta virus, is an infection that causes the liver to become inflamed. This swelling can impair liver function and cause long-term liver problems, including liver scarring and cancer. The condition is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV).","Vaccination against hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D viral infection as hepatitis D requires hepatitis B viral infection to be present in order to infect and replicate in people. Universal vaccination against hepatitis B virus is recommended by the World Health Organization. The hepatitis B vaccine is routinely given soon after birth (usually within 24 hours) to protect against hepatitis B and D viral infection. Latex or polyurethane condoms have been shown to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B, and most likely hepatitis D viral infection. Women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should undergo testing for HBV to know if they carry the virus, this will allow prevention strategies to be implemented during the birth of the child. The CDC recommends that all women who are pregnant be tested for hepatitis B viral infection and that all infants of women with HBV infection be given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth to prevent transmission of the virus from mother to child. Those who get tattoos or body piercings should do so using sterile equipment to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B and D via infected bodily fluids. Hepatitis B and D can also be transmitted from contaminated needles, so those who inject drugs should seek help to stop drug use or use sterile needles and avoid sharing needles with others. Those with hepatitis B or D should also not share razors or other personal care items which may have been contaminated by potentially infectious bodily fluids. Current established treatments for chronic hepatitis D include conventional or pegylated interferon alpha therapy. Evidence suggests that pegylated interferon alpha is effective in reducing the viral load and the effect of the disease during the time the drug is given, but the benefit generally stops if the drug is discontinued. The efficiency of this treatment does not usually exceed about 20%, and late relapse after therapy has been reported. In May 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency approved the antiviral Hepcludex (bulevirtide) to treat hepatitis D. Bulevirtide binds and inactivates the sodium/bile acid cotransporter, blocking hepatitis D virus (as well as hepatitis B virus) from entering hepatocytes. Bulevirtide may be given with pegylated interferon alpha as the two are thought to have a synergistic effect, leading to greater treatment response rates. In patients with HDV-related compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension, the treatment with (bulevirtide) was safe, well tolerated and has led to a significant improvement in biochemical variables and an increase in liver function parameters. Other treatments for hepatitis D which are currently under development include pegylated interferon lambda (λ), which binds to receptors on the hepatocyte surface leading to an intracellular signaling cascade via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and activation of anti-viral cell mediated immunity. The prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib prevents hepatitis D viral particle assembly by inhibiting the farnesylation of the L-HDAg. REP2139-Ca is a nucleic acid polymer that prevents the release of hepatitis B surface antigen (which is required for assembly of hepatitis D viral particles).","['yellow eyes', 'nausea', 'weakness', 'stomach pain']","hepatitis d yellow eyes, nausea, weakness, stomach pain yellow eyes, nausea, weakness, stomach pain. hepatitis d, also known as the hepatitis delta virus, is an infection that causes the liver to become inflamed. this swelling can impair liver function and cause long-term liver problems, including liver scarring and cancer. the condition is caused by the hepatitis d virus (hdv). vaccination against hepatitis b protects against hepatitis d viral infection as hepatitis d requires hepatitis b viral infection to be present in order to infect and replicate in people. universal vaccination against hepatitis b virus is recommended by the world health organization. the hepatitis b vaccine is routinely given soon after birth (usually within 24 hours) to protect against hepatitis b and d viral infection. latex or polyurethane condoms have been shown to prevent the transmission of hepatitis b, and most likely hepatitis d viral infection. women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should undergo testing for hbv to know if they carry the virus, this will allow prevention strategies to be implemented during the birth of the child. the cdc recommends that all women who are pregnant be tested for hepatitis b viral infection and that all infants of women with hbv infection be given hepatitis b immune globulin (hbig) and the hepatitis b vaccine within 12 hours of birth to prevent transmission of the virus from mother to child. those who get tattoos or body piercings should do so using sterile equipment to prevent the transmission of hepatitis b and d via infected bodily fluids. hepatitis b and d can also be transmitted from contaminated needles, so those who inject drugs should seek help to stop drug use or use sterile needles and avoid sharing needles with others. those with hepatitis b or d should also not share razors or other personal care items which may have been contaminated by potentially infectious bodily fluids. current established treatments for chronic hepatitis d include conventional or pegylated interferon alpha therapy. evidence suggests that pegylated interferon alpha is effective in reducing the viral load and the effect of the disease during the time the drug is given, but the benefit generally stops if the drug is discontinued. the efficiency of this treatment does not usually exceed about 20 , and late relapse after therapy has been reported. in may 2020, the committee for medicinal products for human use of the european medicines agency approved the antiviral hepcludex (bulevirtide) to treat hepatitis d. bulevirtide binds and inactivates the sodium/bile acid cotransporter, blocking hepatitis d virus (as well as hepatitis b virus) from entering hepatocytes. bulevirtide may be given with pegylated interferon alpha as the two are thought to have a synergistic effect, leading to greater treatment response rates. in patients with hdv-related compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension, the treatment with (bulevirtide) was safe, well tolerated and has led to a significant improvement in biochemical variables and an increase in liver function parameters. other treatments for hepatitis d which are currently under development include pegylated interferon lambda ( ), which binds to receptors on the hepatocyte surface leading to an intracellular signaling cascade via the jak-stat signaling pathway and activation of anti-viral cell mediated immunity. the prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib prevents hepatitis d viral particle assembly by inhibiting the farnesylation of the l-hdag. rep2139-ca is a nucleic acid polymer that prevents the release of hepatitis b surface antigen (which is required for assembly of hepatitis d viral particles)."

Slightly less than 50% respond to this treatment and need to take supplemental vitamin B6 for the rest of their lives.

Typically this is mediated by cystathionine beta-synthase activity, i.e. those who have adequate CBS activity typically respond to B6 . Occasionally adding cysteineto the diet can be helpful, as glutathione is synthesized from cysteine (so adding cysteine can be important to reduce oxidative stress). Riboflavin, a cofactor for the MTHFR enzyme pathway and multiple glutathione-related pathways, may also be used. Betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) is used to reduce concentrations of homocysteine by promoting the conversion of homocysteine back to methionine, i.e., increasing flux through the re-methylation pathway independent of folate derivatives (which is mainly active in the liver and in the kidneys). The re-formed methionine is then gradually removed by incorporation into body protein. The methionine that is not converted into protein is converted to S-adenosyl-methionine which goes on to form homocysteine again.

Hyperglycemia,,"Hypoglycemia (American English), also spelled hypoglycaemia or hypoglycæmia (British English), sometimes called low blood sugar, is a fall in blood sugar to levels below normal, typically below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Whipple's triad is used to properly identify hypoglycemic episodes. It is defined as blood glucose below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, and resolution of symptoms when blood sugar returns to normal.","Treatment of hyperglycemia requires elimination of the underlying cause, such as diabetes. Acute hyperglycemia can be treated by direct administration of insulin in most cases and may be lessened by the intake of some natural compounds. For example, a single dose of raw cinnamon before a meal containing complex carbohydrates decreases the postprandial hyperglycemia (higher than 140 mg/dL; >7.8 mmol/L) in patients with type II diabetes. Severe hyperglycemia can be treated with oral hypoglycemic therapy and lifestyle modification. In diabetes mellitus (by far the most common cause of chronic hyperglycemia), treatment aims at maintaining blood glucose at a level as close to normal as possible, in order to avoid serious long-term complications. This is done by a combination of proper diet, regular exercise, and insulin or other medication such as metformin. Those with hyperglycaemia can be treated using sulphonylureas or metformin or both. These drugs help by improving glycaemic control. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor alone or in combination with basal insulin can be used as a treatment for hyperglycemia with patients still in hospital. Hyperglycemia can also be improved through minor lifestyle changes. Increasing aerobic exercise to at least 30 minutes a day causes the body to make better use of accumulated glucose since the glucose is being converted to energy by the muscles. Calorie monitoring, with restriction as necessary, can reduce over-eating, which contributes to hyperglycemia. Diets higher in healthy unsaturated fats and whole-wheat carbohydrates such as the Mediterranean diet can help reduce carbohydrate intake to better control hyperglycemia. Diets such as intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet help reduce calorie consumption which could significantly reduce hyperglycemia. Carbohydrates are the main cause for hyperglycemia. Non-whole-wheat items should be substituted by whole-wheat items.

Hyperhidrosis,"Excessive sweating (beyond what is necessary for temperature regulation), typically in specific areas (such as palms, soles, underarms), may interfere with daily activities","Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition in which a person exhibits excessive sweating, more than is required for the regulation of body temperature. Although it is primarily a physical burden, hyperhidrosis can deteriorate the quality of life of the people who are affected, frequently leading to psychological, physical, and social consequences. Hyperhidrosis can lead to difficulties in professional fields, with more than 80% of patients experiencing moderate to severe emotional effects from the disease.","Antihydral cream is one of the solutions prescribed for hyperhidrosis for palms. Topical agents for hyperhidrosis therapy include formaldehyde lotion and topical anticholinergics. These agents reduce perspiration by denaturing keratin, in turn occluding the pores of the sweat glands. They have a short-lasting effect. Formaldehyde is classified as a probable human carcinogen. Contact sensitization is increased, especially with formalin. Aluminium chlorohydrate is used in regular antiperspirants. However, hyperhidrosis requires solutions or gels with a much higher concentration. These antiperspirant solutions or hyperhidrosis gels are especially effective for treatment of axillary or underarm regions. It takes three to five days to see improvement. The most common side-effect is skin irritation. For severe cases of plantar and palmar hyperhidrosis, there has been some success with conservative measures such as higher strength aluminium chloride antiperspirants. Treatment algorithms for hyperhidrosis recommend topical antiperspirants as the first line of therapy for hyperhidrosis. The International Hyperhidrosis Society has published evidence-based treatment guidelines for focal and generalized hyperhidrosis. Prescription medications called anticholinergics, often taken by mouth, are sometimes used in the treatment of both generalized and focal hyperhidrosis. Anticholinergics used for hyperhidrosis include propantheline, glycopyrronium bromide or glycopyrrolate, oxybutynin, methantheline, and benzatropine. Use of these drugs can be limited, however, by side-effects, including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and visual disturbances such as mydriasis and cycloplegia. For people who find their hyperhidrosis is made worse by anxiety-provoking situations (public speaking, stage performances, special events such as weddings, etc.), taking an anticholinergic medicine before the event may help. In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the topical anticholinergic glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. For peripheral hyperhidrosis, some people have found relief by simply ingesting crushed ice water.

Hyperprolactinemia,"Galactorrhea, irregular menstruation, infertility","Galactorrhea, irregular menstruation, infertility. Kelebihan hormon prolaktin.","The treatment for hyperprolactinemia is usually dependent upon its cause. There are many underlying factor that can cause hyperprolactinemia, some of them are hypothyroidism (disorder in which thyroid glands has a reduced thyroid hormone production), drug-induced hyperprolactinemia (such as antidepressant medication, antihypertensive medication and medication that can promotes bowel motility), hypothalamic disease(disorder caused by damage in the hypothalamus), idiopathic hyperprolactinemia (no recognized cause are present since there is no pituitary or central nervous disease present), macroprolactin (complex form of prolactin in the blood), or prolactinoma (non-cancerous tumor in the pituitary gland). Because there are so many underlying factors, to provide the proper management of hyperprolactinemia, the pathological form and physiological increase in prolactin levels are differentiated, and the correct cause of hyperprolactinemia must be identified before treatment. There are two types of functional hyperprolactinemia: symptomatic and asymptomatic. For functional asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, the treatment of choice is removing the associated cause, including antipsychotic therapy. However, prolactin levels should be drawn and monitored both before any discontinuation or changes to therapy and afterwards. In contrast to functional asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, the treatment for functional symptomatic hyperprolactinemia is different since stopping antipsychotic drugs for a short trial period is not recommended due to the risk of exacerbation or relapse of symptoms. A systematic review and meta-analysis have shown that options for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia in people with psychotic disorder include decreasing the dose of antipsychotics, adding aripiprazole as an adjunctive therapy, and switching antipsychotics as a last resort. On the other hand, the treatment of hyperprolactinemia in children and adolescents with antipsychotic medications has been studied to provide guidelines, as these medications may adversely affect child growth and development. Results have shown that aripiprazole significantly decreases prolactin levels compared to other medications such as olanzapine and risperidone, which result in increased prolactin levels. Pharmacologic hyperprolactinemia, the concerning drug can be switched to another treatment or discontinued entirely. No treatment is required in asymptomatic macroprolactin and instead, serial prolactin measurements and pituitary imaging are monitored in regular follow-up appointments. Medical therapy is the preferred treatment for prolactinomas. In most cases, medications that are dopamine agonists, such as cabergoline, quinagolide and bromocriptine (often preferred when pregnancy is possible), are the treatment of choice used to decrease prolactin levels and tumor size upon the presence of microadenomas or macroadenomas. A systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that cabergoline and quinagolide are more effective in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia compared to bromocriptine, this is because evidence had suggested fewer side effects, rapid titration and offers better dosing interval in medication like quinagolide compared to bromocriptine. Similar studies have been conducted regarding the safety and efficacy of dopamine agonists. According to SUCRA (Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking) and SMAA (Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis), quinagolide was found to be the best treatment for women since it can help reduce menstrual irregularities, in addition bromocriptine was shown to be more effective in the treatment for galactorrhea (breast milk production unrelated to pregnancy), and cabergoline was the safest medication as it did not show any alarming side effects. Other dopamine agonists that have been used less commonly to suppress prolactin include dihydroergocryptine, ergoloid, lisuride, metergoline, pergolide, and terguride. If the prolactinoma does not initially respond to dopamine agonist therapy, such that prolactin levels are still high or the tumor is not shrinking as expected, the dose of the dopamine agonist can be increased in a stepwise fashion to the maximum tolerated dose. Another option is to consider switching between dopamine agonists. The prolactinoma can be resistant to bromocriptine but respond well to cabergoline or other dopamine agonists, and vice versa. It is crucial for people undergoing treatment with dopamine agonists to adhere to their medication and not stop it unless instructed by their medical provider. Meta-analysis and systematic reviews have shown that in many patients, hyperprolactinemia reemerges after withdrawal of the medication. For successful treatment with cabergoline, a duration of at least two years is recommended. Surgical therapy can be considered if pharmacologic options have been exhausted. There is evidence to support improvement in outcomes in hyperprolactinemic patients who have shown to be resistant to or intolerant of the most effective treatment with dopamine agonists; for those patients, radiotherapy and surgery are an alternative. Although some studies have tried to explain the consequences of untreated hyperprolactinemia, there are limited studies available. However, it has been shown that some consequences can lead to osteoporosis (low bone mass), increasing the risk of fracture.

Recommended lifestyle changes for the prevention of hypertension include: maintain normal body weight for adults (e.g. body mass index below 25 kg/m2) reduce dietary sodium intake to <100 mmol/day (<6 g of salt (sodium chloride) or <2.4 g of sodium per day) engage in regular aerobic physical activity with moderate intensity (minimum 150 minutes per week) limit alcohol consumption, max 1 drink for women and 2 for men per day consume a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, such as the DASH diet not smoking stress reduction and management, e.g. by meditation and yoga Effective lifestyle modification may lower blood pressure as much as an individual antihypertensive medication.

Hypogonadism,"Lack of sex hormones, infertility, tiredness","Lack of sex hormones, infertility, tiredness. Gangguan testis/ovarium atau hipotalamus/pituitari.","Male primary or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is often treated with testosterone replacement therapy if they are not trying to conceive. In short- and medium-term testosterone replacement therapy the risk of cardiovascular events (including strokes and heart attacks and other heart diseases) is not increased. The long-term safety of the therapy is not known yet. Side effects can include an elevation of hematocrit to levels that require blood withdrawal (phlebotomy) to prevent complications from excessively thick blood. Gynecomastia (growth of breasts in men) sometimes occurs. Finally, some physicians worry that obstructive sleep apnea may worsen with testosterone therapy, and should be monitored. While historically, men with prostate cancer risk were warned against testosterone therapy, that has shown to be a myth. Another treatment for hypogonadism is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This stimulates the LH receptor, thereby promoting testosterone synthesis. This will not be effective in men whose testes simply cannot synthesize testosterone anymore (primary hypogonadism), and the failure of hCG therapy is further support for the existence of true testicular failure in a patient. It is particularly indicated in men with hypogonadism who wish to retain their fertility, as it does not suppress spermatogenesis (sperm production) as testosterone replacement therapy does. For both men and women, an alternative to testosterone replacement is low-dose clomifene treatment, which can stimulate the body to naturally increase hormone levels while avoiding infertility and other side effects that can result from direct hormone replacement therapy. Clomifene blocks estrogen from binding to some estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, thereby causing an increased release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and subsequently LH from the pituitary.

Hypospadias,"Abnormal positioning of the urethral opening on the underside of the penis, penile curvature, spraying of urine, difficulty in urination","Hypospadias is a common malformation in fetal development of the penis in which the urethra does not open from its usual location on the head of the penis. It is the second-most common birth defect of the male reproductive system, affecting about one of every 250 males at birth, although when including milder cases, is found in up to 4% of newborn males. Roughly 90% of cases are the less serious distal hypospadias, in which the urethral opening (the meatus) is on or near the head of the penis (glans).","Where hypospadias is seen as a genital ambiguity in a child, the World Health Organization standard of care is to delay surgery until the child is old enough to participate in informed consent, unless emergency surgery is needed because the child lacks a urinary opening. Hypospadias is not a serious medical condition. A urinary opening that is not surrounded by glans tissue is more likely to ""spray"" the urine, which can cause a person to sit to urinate because they cannot reliably stand and hit the toilet. Chordee is a separate condition, but where it occurs, the downward curvature of the penis may be enough to make sexual penetration more difficult. For these reasons or others, people with hypospadias may choose to seek urethroplasty, a surgical extension of the urethra using a skin graft. Surgery can extend the urinary channel to the end of the penis, straighten bending, and/or change the foreskin (by either circumcision or by altering its appearance to look more typical (""preputioplasty"")), depending on the desire of the patient. Urethroplasty failure rates vary enormously, from around 5% for the simplest repairs to damage in a normal urethra by an experienced surgeon, to 15-20% when a buccal graft from the inside of the mouth can be used to extend a urethra, to close to 50% when graft urethral tubes are constructed from other skin. When the hypospadias is extensive–third degree/penoscrotal–or has associated differences in sex development such as chordee or cryptorchidism, the best management can be a more complicated decision. The world standard (UN and WHO) forbids nonessential surgery to produce a ""normal"" appearance without the informed consent of the patient, and the American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends but does not require the same standard. The AAP Textbook of Pediatric Care states ""Gender assignment in patients with genital ambiguity should be made only after careful investigation by a multidisciplinary team; increasingly, surgical decisions are delayed until the child is able to participate in the decision-making process."" A karyotype and endocrine evaluation should be performed to detect intersex conditions or hormone deficiencies that have major health risks (i.e. salt-wasting). If the penis is small, testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injections may be given with consent to enlarge it before surgery if this will increase the chance of a successful urethral repair. Surgical repair of severe hypospadias may require multiple procedures and mucosal grafting. Preputial skin is often used for grafting and circumcision should be avoided before repair. In patients with severe hypospadias, surgery often produces unsatisfactory results, such as scarring, curvature, or formation of urethral fistulas, diverticula, or strictures. A fistula is an unwanted opening through the skin along the course of the urethra, and can result in urinary leakage or an abnormal stream. A diverticulum is an ""outpocketing"" of the lining of the urethra which interferes with urinary flow and may result in posturination leakage. A stricture is a narrowing of the urethra severe enough to obstruct flow. Reduced complication rates even for third-degree repair (e.g., fistula rates below 5%) have been reported in recent years from centers with the most experience. However, typical complications in urethroplasty for severe hypospadias can lead to long surgical cycles of failure and repair, and side effects may include loss of sexual or urinary function. Research suggests failure rates are higher when urethroplasty corrects a born condition rather than disease or injury so patients and families considering surgery for hypospadias should have realistic expectations about the risks and benefits.","['abnormal positioning of the urethral opening on the underside of the penis', 'penile curvature', 'spraying of urine', 'difficulty in urination']","hypospadias abnormal positioning of the urethral opening on the underside of the penis, penile curvature, spraying of urine, difficulty in urination hypospadias is a common malformation in fetal development of the penis in which the urethra does not open from its usual location on the head of the penis. it is the second-most common birth defect of the male reproductive system, affecting about one of every 250 males at birth, although when including milder cases, is found in up to 4 of newborn males. roughly 90 of cases are the less serious distal hypospadias, in which the urethral opening (the meatus) is on or near the head of the penis (glans). where hypospadias is seen as a genital ambiguity in a child, the world health organization standard of care is to delay surgery until the child is old enough to participate in informed consent, unless emergency surgery is needed because the child lacks a urinary opening. hypospadias is not a serious medical condition. a urinary opening that is not surrounded by glans tissue is more likely to spray the urine, which can cause a person to sit to urinate because they cannot reliably stand and hit the toilet. chordee is a separate condition, but where it occurs, the downward curvature of the penis may be enough to make sexual penetration more difficult. for these reasons or others, people with hypospadias may choose to seek urethroplasty, a surgical extension of the urethra using a skin graft. surgery can extend the urinary channel to the end of the penis, straighten bending, and/or change the foreskin (by either circumcision or by altering its appearance to look more typical ( preputioplasty )), depending on the desire of the patient. urethroplasty failure rates vary enormously, from around 5 for the simplest repairs to damage in a normal urethra by an experienced surgeon, to 15-20 when a buccal graft from the inside of the mouth can be used to extend a urethra, to close to 50 when graft urethral tubes are constructed from other skin. when the hypospadias is extensive third degree/penoscrotal or has associated differences in sex development such as chordee or cryptorchidism, the best management can be a more complicated decision. the world standard (un and who) forbids nonessential surgery to produce a normal appearance without the informed consent of the patient, and the american academy of pediatrics currently recommends but does not require the same standard. the aap textbook of pediatric care states gender assignment in patients with genital ambiguity should be made only after careful investigation by a multidisciplinary team increasingly, surgical decisions are delayed until the child is able to participate in the decision-making process. a karyotype and endocrine evaluation should be performed to detect intersex conditions or hormone deficiencies that have major health risks (i.e. salt-wasting). if the penis is small, testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) injections may be given with consent to enlarge it before surgery if this will increase the chance of a successful urethral repair. surgical repair of severe hypospadias may require multiple procedures and mucosal grafting. preputial skin is often used for grafting and circumcision should be avoided before repair. in patients with severe hypospadias, surgery often produces unsatisfactory results, such as scarring, curvature, or formation of urethral fistulas, diverticula, or strictures. a fistula is an unwanted opening through the skin along the course of the urethra, and can result in urinary leakage or an abnormal stream. a diverticulum is an outpocketing of the lining of the urethra which interferes with urinary flow and may result in posturination leakage. a stricture is a narrowing of the urethra severe enough to obstruct flow. reduced complication rates even for third-degree repair (e.g., fistula rates below 5 ) have been reported in recent years from centers with the most experience. however, typical complications in urethroplasty for severe hypospadias can lead to long surgical cycles of failure and repair, and side effects may include loss of sexual or urinary function. research suggests failure rates are higher when urethroplasty corrects a born condition rather than disease or injury so patients and families considering surgery for hypospadias should have realistic expectations about the risks and benefits."

Children with impetigo can return to school 24 hours after starting antibiotic therapy as long as their draining lesions are covered. Antibiotics, either as a cream or by mouth, are usually prescribed. Mild cases may be treated with mupirocin ointments. In 95% of cases, a single seven-day antibiotic course results in resolution in children. It has been advocated that topical antiseptics are inferior to topical antibiotics, and therefore should not be used as a replacement. However, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as of February 2020 recommends a hydrogen peroxide 1% cream antiseptic rather than topical antibiotics for localised non-bullous impetigo in otherwise well individuals. This recommendation is part of an effort to reduce the overuse of antimicrobials that may contribute to the development of resistant organisms such as MRSA. More severe cases require oral antibiotics, such as dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. Alternatively, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins (first-generation) and many others may also be used as an antibiotic treatment. Alternatives for people who are seriously allergic to penicillin or infections with methicillin-resistant Staphococcus aureus include doxycycline, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, although doxycycline should not be used in children under the age of eight years old due to the risk of drug-induced tooth discolouration.

Intertrigo,"Red, raw, or inflamed skin in skin folds (such as armpits or groin), itching or burning sensation","Intertrigo, commonly called ""skin fold dermatitis"", refers to a type of inflammatory rash (dermatitis) of the superficial skin that occurs within a person's body folds. These areas are more susceptible to irritation and subsequent infection due to factors that promote skin breakdown such as moisture, friction, and exposure to bodily secretions and excreta such as sweat, urine, or feces. Areas of the body which are more likely to be affected by intertrigo include the inframammary fold, intergluteal cleft, armpits, and spaces between the fingers or toes.","Treatment for intertrigo focuses on managing excess moisture, friction, and addressing secondary infections. Initial management emphasizes prevention and patient education. Patients are often advised to wear loose, breathable clothing (such as cotton) and avoid synthetic fabrics. Moisture-wicking textiles designed for skin folds are also increasingly recommended due to their ability to wick away moisture, promote evaporation, reduce friction, and often provide antimicrobial properties through embedded silver. Daily skin fold hygiene, including cleansing with a pH-balanced cleanser (avoiding alkaline soaps) and thorough drying, is commonly advised. Skin barrier products are also commonly suggested to protect against both moisture and friction. While specific product selection guidance is limited, barrier creams containing zinc oxide or honey have been used. Absorptive powders like talc or cornstarch are generally no longer recommended. Secondary infections often require targeted treatment. For fungal and candidal infections, topical antifungals (clotrimazole, nystatin, miconazole) are typical; severe cases may require systemic antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole). Topical miconazole is sometimes preferred for its additional antibacterial action. Treatment usually lasts at least two weeks. For significant inflammation and itching, combination antifungal/low-potency corticosteroid preparations may be used, though evidence supporting corticosteroids over antifungals alone is limited. Bacterial infections may require topical or systemic antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), used judiciously due to antimicrobial resistance concerns. In severe or refractory cases where medical management fails, surgical options may be considered. These include procedures to remove excess skin and tissue, such as panniculectomy (removal of excess abdominal skin and fat) or other body contouring procedures. Breast reduction can be beneficial for women with macromastia, and post-bariatric patients with excess skin folds may also benefit from body contouring procedures to reduce skin-on-skin contact and improve hygiene.

Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Joint pain, swelling, stiffness, limited range of motion, fever, rash","Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), is the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood, affecting approximately 3.8 to 400 out of 100,000 children. Juvenile refers to disease onset before 16 years of age, while idiopathic refers to a condition with no defined cause, and arthritis is inflammation within the joint. JIA is an autoimmune, noninfective, inflammatory joint disease, the cause of which remains poorly understood.","The major emphasis of the treatment of JIA is helping the child or young person regain normal levels of physical and social functioning by controlling inflammation and extra-articular symptoms. Clinical remission should be the primary target for all people. Prompt recognition and management is important as early initiation of medication therapy increases the likelihood of a response to first-line treatments and low disability. Consensus treatment guidelines exist for the treatment of JIA. Optimal management of JIA requires a multidisciplinary team working to address the needs of an individual child. Optimizing physical and social functioning is accomplished using non-pharmacological strategies such as physical therapies, pain management strategies, and social supports. Medications are used to control inflammation and reduce or prevent extra-articular symptoms. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used for symptomatic relief of joint pain in children with JIA. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) which inhibit specific pathways in the inflammation pathways responsible for JIA are a primary treatment. Lifelong DMARD treatment is often required and drug-free remission is exceedingly rare. Oligoarticular JIA (which comprises 40-50% of all JIA cases) by definition involves 4 or fewer joints in the first 6 months of the disease. After 6 months, some cases become polyarticular (involving more than 4 joints). This polyarticular subtype is associated with a lower remission rate with medical therapy. Intra-articular steroid injections often help with treatment in oligoarticular JIA. Conventional synthetic DMARDs such as methotrexate are a first line therapy and biologic DMARDs such as TNF-α inhibitors may be added on for refractory cases. Rheumatoid factor negative polyarticular JIA (15-20% of all JIA cases) can be treated with synthetic conventional DMARDs (such as methotrexate) with biologic DMARDs (such as TNF inhibitors) being a second line add-on treatment option. Rheumatoid factor positive JIA (5% of JIA cases, and also being rare in children younger than 9-years old) is associated with a poor prognosis and early treatment is required to prevent significant joint destruction and disability. It is very similar pathologically to adult rheumatoid arthritis. Synthetic conventional DMARDs or biologic DMARDs are standard therapy for this type of JIA. Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of JIA characterized by enthesitis; inflammation of the area where tendons and ligaments attach to bone. NSAIDs are commonly used for symptomatic relief with the anti-inflammatories sulfasalazine and TNF-inhibitors also being used. Biologic DMARDs such as TNF-α inhibitors are used for sacroilitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joint). IL-17 inhibitors are used for refractory disease. 40-60% of children with enthesitis related variant of JIA have involvement of the axial skeleton including sacroiliitis, spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis (inflammation of the spine). Psoriatic JIA typically presents in children between the ages of 2-4 and older than 10 years, having a bi-modal age of onset. 50% of children with psoriatic JIA develop psoriasis. Adolescents and older children have a similar presentation to psoriatic arthritis (the adult continuation of this type of JIA). Treatment consists of synthetic DMARDs such as methotrexate or TNF-α inhibitors. DMARDs targeting inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-12, or IL-23 may be used. Systemic JIA is characterized by markedly elevated inflammatory markers, fevers and rashes. It may also present as lymph node swelling, hepatosplenomegaly (swelling of the liver and spleen) and as a life threatening hyperinflammation syndrome known as macrophage activation syndrome. Early treatment with IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors may induce remission. DMARDs combined with systemic steroids may be needed in severe inflammation or the macrophage activation syndrome. Systemic JIA is pathologically similar to Adult-Onset Still's Disease and this is thought to be the adult continuation of the same disease.","['joint pain', 'swelling', 'stiffness', 'limited range of motion', 'fever', 'rash']","juvenile rheumatoid arthritis joint pain, swelling, stiffness, limited range of motion, fever, rash juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia), formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (jra), is the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood, affecting approximately 3.8 to 400 out of 100,000 children. juvenile refers to disease onset before 16 years of age, while idiopathic refers to a condition with no defined cause, and arthritis is inflammation within the joint. jia is an autoimmune, noninfective, inflammatory joint disease, the cause of which remains poorly understood. the major emphasis of the treatment of jia is helping the child or young person regain normal levels of physical and social functioning by controlling inflammation and extra-articular symptoms. clinical remission should be the primary target for all people. prompt recognition and management is important as early initiation of medication therapy increases the likelihood of a response to first-line treatments and low disability. consensus treatment guidelines exist for the treatment of jia. optimal management of jia requires a multidisciplinary team working to address the needs of an individual child. optimizing physical and social functioning is accomplished using non-pharmacological strategies such as physical therapies, pain management strategies, and social supports. medications are used to control inflammation and reduce or prevent extra-articular symptoms. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are used for symptomatic relief of joint pain in children with jia. disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards) which inhibit specific pathways in the inflammation pathways responsible for jia are a primary treatment. lifelong dmard treatment is often required and drug-free remission is exceedingly rare. oligoarticular jia (which comprises 40-50 of all jia cases) by definition involves 4 or fewer joints in the first 6 months of the disease. after 6 months, some cases become polyarticular (involving more than 4 joints). this polyarticular subtype is associated with a lower remission rate with medical therapy. intra-articular steroid injections often help with treatment in oligoarticular jia. conventional synthetic dmards such as methotrexate are a first line therapy and biologic dmards such as tnf- inhibitors may be added on for refractory cases. rheumatoid factor negative polyarticular jia (15-20 of all jia cases) can be treated with synthetic conventional dmards (such as methotrexate) with biologic dmards (such as tnf inhibitors) being a second line add-on treatment option. rheumatoid factor positive jia (5 of jia cases, and also being rare in children younger than 9-years old) is associated with a poor prognosis and early treatment is required to prevent significant joint destruction and disability. it is very similar pathologically to adult rheumatoid arthritis. synthetic conventional dmards or biologic dmards are standard therapy for this type of jia. enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of jia characterized by enthesitis inflammation of the area where tendons and ligaments attach to bone. nsaids are commonly used for symptomatic relief with the anti-inflammatories sulfasalazine and tnf-inhibitors also being used. biologic dmards such as tnf- inhibitors are used for sacroilitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joint). il-17 inhibitors are used for refractory disease. 40-60 of children with enthesitis related variant of jia have involvement of the axial skeleton including sacroiliitis, spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis (inflammation of the spine). psoriatic jia typically presents in children between the ages of 2-4 and older than 10 years, having a bi-modal age of onset. 50 of children with psoriatic jia develop psoriasis. adolescents and older children have a similar presentation to psoriatic arthritis (the adult continuation of this type of jia). treatment consists of synthetic dmards such as methotrexate or tnf- inhibitors. dmards targeting inflammatory cytokines il-17, il-12, or il-23 may be used. systemic jia is characterized by markedly elevated inflammatory markers, fevers and rashes. it may also present as lymph node swelling, hepatosplenomegaly (swelling of the liver and spleen) and as a life threatening hyperinflammation syndrome known as macrophage activation syndrome. early treatment with il-1 and il-6 inhibitors may induce remission. dmards combined with systemic steroids may be needed in severe inflammation or the macrophage activation syndrome. systemic jia is pathologically similar to adult-onset still s disease and this is thought to be the adult continuation of the same disease."

Kawasaki Disease,"High fever, rash, chapped lips, red eyes","High fever, rash, chapped lips, red eyes. Penyakit peradangan pembuluh darah pada anak.","Children with Kawasaki disease should be hospitalized and cared for by a physician who has experience with this disease. In an academic medical center, care is often shared between pediatric cardiology, pediatric rheumatology, and pediatric infectious disease specialists (although no specific infectious agent has yet been identified). To prevent damage to coronary arteries, treatment should be started immediately following the diagnosis. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease and is administered in high doses with marked improvement usually noted within 24 hours. If the fever does not respond, an additional dose may be considered. In rare cases, a third dose may be given. IVIG is most useful within the first seven days of fever onset, to prevent coronary artery aneurysm. IVIG given within the first 10 days of the disease reduces the risk of damage to the coronary arteries in children, without serious adverse effects. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that no prediction models of IVIG resistance in patients with Kawasaki disease could accurately distinguish the resistance. The largest clinical study to date on treatment of resistant Kawasaki disease has shown that infliximab is more effective and safer than a second dose of IVIG in treating children with IVIG-resistant Kawasaki Disease, offering faster fever resolution and reduced hospitalization times without significant adverse events. Salicylate therapy, particularly aspirin, remains an important part of the treatment (though questioned by some) but salicylates alone are not as effective as IVIG. There is limited evidence to indicate whether children should continue to receive salicylate as part of their treatment. Aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when the patient returns home, usually for two months to prevent blood clots from forming. Except for Kawasaki disease and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise normally not recommended for children due to its association with Reye syndrome. Because children with Kawasaki disease will be taking aspirin for up to several months, vaccination against varicella and influenza is required, as these infections are most likely to cause Reye syndrome. High-dose aspirin is associated with anemia and does not confer benefit to disease outcomes. About 15-20% of children following the initial IVIG infusion show persistent or recurrent fever and are classified as IVIG-resistant. While the use of TNF alpha blockers (TNF-α) may reduce treatment resistance and the infusion reaction after treatment initiation, further research is needed. Due to the potential involvement of the upregulated calcium-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway in the development of the disease, a 2019 study found that the combination of ciclosporin and IVIG infusion can suppress coronary artery abnormalities. Further research is needed to determine which patients would respond best to this treatment. Corticosteroids have also been used, especially when other treatments fail or symptoms recur, but in a randomized controlled trial, the addition of corticosteroid to immune globulin and aspirin did not improve outcome. Additionally, corticosteroid use in the setting of Kawasaki disease is associated with increased risk of coronary artery aneurysm, so its use is generally contraindicated in this setting. In cases of Kawasaki disease refractory to IVIG, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange have been investigated as possible treatments, with variable outcomes. However, a Cochrane review published in 2017 (updated in 2022) found that, in children, the use of corticosteroids in the acute phase of KD was associated with improved coronary artery abnormalities, shorter hospital stays, a decreased duration of clinical symptoms, and reduced inflammatory marker levels. Patient populations based in Asia, people with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use.","['high fever', 'rash', 'chapped lips', 'red eyes']","kawasaki disease high fever, rash, chapped lips, red eyes high fever, rash, chapped lips, red eyes. penyakit peradangan pembuluh darah pada anak. children with kawasaki disease should be hospitalized and cared for by a physician who has experience with this disease. in an academic medical center, care is often shared between pediatric cardiology, pediatric rheumatology, and pediatric infectious disease specialists (although no specific infectious agent has yet been identified). to prevent damage to coronary arteries, treatment should be started immediately following the diagnosis. intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) is the standard treatment for kawasaki disease and is administered in high doses with marked improvement usually noted within 24 hours. if the fever does not respond, an additional dose may be considered. in rare cases, a third dose may be given. ivig is most useful within the first seven days of fever onset, to prevent coronary artery aneurysm. ivig given within the first 10 days of the disease reduces the risk of damage to the coronary arteries in children, without serious adverse effects. a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that no prediction models of ivig resistance in patients with kawasaki disease could accurately distinguish the resistance. the largest clinical study to date on treatment of resistant kawasaki disease has shown that infliximab is more effective and safer than a second dose of ivig in treating children with ivig-resistant kawasaki disease, offering faster fever resolution and reduced hospitalization times without significant adverse events. salicylate therapy, particularly aspirin, remains an important part of the treatment (though questioned by some) but salicylates alone are not as effective as ivig. there is limited evidence to indicate whether children should continue to receive salicylate as part of their treatment. aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when the patient returns home, usually for two months to prevent blood clots from forming. except for kawasaki disease and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise normally not recommended for children due to its association with reye syndrome. because children with kawasaki disease will be taking aspirin for up to several months, vaccination against varicella and influenza is required, as these infections are most likely to cause reye syndrome. high-dose aspirin is associated with anemia and does not confer benefit to disease outcomes. about 15-20 of children following the initial ivig infusion show persistent or recurrent fever and are classified as ivig-resistant. while the use of tnf alpha blockers (tnf- ) may reduce treatment resistance and the infusion reaction after treatment initiation, further research is needed. due to the potential involvement of the upregulated calcium-nuclear factor of activated t cells pathway in the development of the disease, a 2019 study found that the combination of ciclosporin and ivig infusion can suppress coronary artery abnormalities. further research is needed to determine which patients would respond best to this treatment. corticosteroids have also been used, especially when other treatments fail or symptoms recur, but in a randomized controlled trial, the addition of corticosteroid to immune globulin and aspirin did not improve outcome. additionally, corticosteroid use in the setting of kawasaki disease is associated with increased risk of coronary artery aneurysm, so its use is generally contraindicated in this setting. in cases of kawasaki disease refractory to ivig, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange have been investigated as possible treatments, with variable outcomes. however, a cochrane review published in 2017 (updated in 2022) found that, in children, the use of corticosteroids in the acute phase of kd was associated with improved coronary artery abnormalities, shorter hospital stays, a decreased duration of clinical symptoms, and reduced inflammatory marker levels. patient populations based in asia, people with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use."
Kidney Cancer,,"Kidney cancer, also known as renal cancer, is a group of cancers that starts in the kidney. Symptoms may include blood in the urine, a lump in the abdomen, or back pain. Fever, weight loss, and tiredness may also occur.","Treatment for kidney cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease. Surgery is the most common treatment as kidney cancer does not often respond to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgical complexity can be estimated by the RENAL Nephrometry Scoring System. If the cancer has not spread it will usually be removed by surgery. In some cases this involves removing the whole kidney however most tumors are amenable to partial removal to eradicate the tumor and preserve the remaining normal portion of the kidney. Surgery is not always possible – for example, the patient may have other medical conditions that prevent it, or the cancer may have spread around the body and doctors may not be able to remove it. If the cancer cannot be treated with surgery, other techniques such as freezing the tumour or treating it with high temperatures may be used. However, these are not yet used as standard treatments for kidney cancer. Recently, evidence stemming from the KEYNOTE-564 study has shed light on the potential use of systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting, with promising results. Patients exhibiting specific clear cell RCC tumor characteristics and having undergone treatment with Pembrolizumab for 17 cycles (around 1 year) had significant improvement in disease-free survival. However, the study has yet to yield conclusive findings in relation to overall survival. Other treatment options include biological therapies such as everolimus, torisel, nexavar, sutent, and axitinib, the use of immunotherapy including interferon and interleukin-2. Immunotherapy is successful in 10 to 15% of people. Sunitinib is the current standard of care in the adjuvant setting along with pazopanib; these treatments are often followed by everolimus, axitinib, and sorafenib. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are also in trials for kidney cancer, and some have gained approval for medical use. In the second line setting, nivolumab demonstrated an overall survival advantage in advanced clear renal cell carcinoma over everolimus in 2015 and was approved by the FDA. Cabozantinib also demonstrated an overall survival benefit over everolimus and was approved by the FDA as a second-line treatment in 2016. Lenvatinib in combination with everolimus was approved in 2016 for patients who have had exactly one prior line of angiogenic therapy.

Kidney Stone,"Severe pain in the side or back, blood in the urine, frequent urination","Kidney stone disease or urinary stone disease is a crystallopathy that occurs when there are too many minerals in the urine and not enough liquid or hydration.

Because renal calculi typically form in the kidney, if small enough, they are able to leave the urinary tract via the urine stream.","Preventative measures depend on the type of stones. In those with calcium stones, drinking plenty of fluids, thiazide diuretics and citrate are effective as is allopurinol in those with high uric acid levels in urine. Stone size influences the rate of spontaneous stone passage. For example, up to 98% of small stones (less than 5 mm (0.2 in) in diameter) may pass spontaneously through urination within four weeks of the onset of symptoms, but for larger stones (5 to 10 mm (0.2 to 0.4 in) in diameter), the rate of spontaneous passage decreases to less than 53%. Initial stone location also influences the likelihood of spontaneous stone passage. Rates increase from 48% for stones located in the proximal ureter to 79% for stones located at the vesicoureteric junction, regardless of stone size. Assuming no high-grade obstruction or associated infection is found in the urinary tract, and symptoms are relatively mild, various nonsurgical measures can be used to encourage the passage of a stone.

Lead Poisoning,"Fatigue, abdominal pain, joint pain, memory loss or cognitive difficulties, developmental delays (in children), anemia","Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by the presence of lead in the human body. Symptoms of lead poisoning may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, infertility, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. Lead poisoning causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems.","Prevention for lead poisoning can be divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention methods. The mainstays of treatment are removal from the source of lead and, for people who have significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part of treatment for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations. Before the advent of organic chelating agents, salts of iodide were given orally, such as heavily popularized by Louis Melsens and many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century doctors. A chelating agent is a molecule with at least two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally. Chelation therapy is used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is considered for people with blood lead levels above 25 μg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus, repeated treatments are often necessary. People receiving dimercaprol need to be assessed for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS before calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This may be the case in instances where children have a blood lead level >25 μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or the inability to reverse preexisting damage. Chelating agents can have adverse effects; for example, chelation therapy can lower the body's levels of necessary nutrients like zinc. Chelating agents taken orally can increase the body's absorption of lead through the intestine. Chelation challenge, also known as provocation testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique has been used to determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.","['fatigue', 'abdominal pain', 'joint pain', 'memory loss or

Follow the instructions on the label of the repellent. The most effective repellents generally are those that contain the chemical DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide) Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by using nets treated with insecticide or insect repellent while sleeping. To provide good protection against sandflies, fine mesh sizes of 0.6 mm or less are required, but a mosquito net with 1.2mm mesh will provide a limited reduction in the number of sandfly bites. Finer mesh sizes have the downside of higher cost and reduced air circulation which can cause overheating. Many Phlebotomine sandfly attacks occur at sunset rather than at night, so it may also be useful to put nets over doors and windows or to use insect repellents. Use of insecticide-impregnated dog collars and treatment or culling of infected dogs. Spraying houses and animal shelters with insecticides. Prevention and control of leishmaniasis requires a multifaceted approach. Insecticide spraying, treated nets, and case management are commonly used strategies, while additional approaches are being explored for long-term disease control. Vector Control: Integrated Vector Management (IVM) approach is key to reducing sand fly populations. Some of the latest strategies include: Research is ongoing into genetically modifying sand flies to reduce their ability to transmit Leishmania parasites. Attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSBs) attract and kill sand flies that feed on plant sugars. Spatial repellents and insecticidal paint create long-term barriers against sand flies. Reservoir Control: Canine control measures: domestic dogs are major reservoirs for Leishmania infantum in regions where visceral leishmaniasis is common. Instead of widespread dog culling, which has been proven ineffective and controversial, deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars have been introduced as a safer and more effective alternative. Wildlife reservoirs: Controlling wild animal reservoirs such as rodents, marsupials, sloths, and armadillos is more challenging due to conservation concerns. Vaccination: Canine vaccinations have been developed and are now being used in some regions to reduce transmission. Human vaccinations are in development, with several candidates in clinical trials assessing their potential for long-term immunity. The treatment is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, and the type of infection. For visceral leishmaniasis in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment and is often used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within three months of getting pregnant. It does not appear to work for L. major or L. braziliensis. Trifluralin, a herbicide, is shown to be effective treatment as ointment, without hemolytic or cell-toxic side-effects. Recent research in leishmaniasis treatment explores combination therapies, nanotechnology-based drugs, and immunotherapy. Combination treatments, such as liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) with miltefosine or paromomycin, have shown high cure rates for visceral leishmaniasis while reducing treatment time and side effects. The WHO recommends miltefosine-based combination therapy for specific cases of visceral leishmaniasis. Nanotechnology-based treatments, including lipid and metallic nanoparticles, improve drug delivery by targeting parasites more precisely and reducing toxicity. Immune-modulating therapies, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), are under investigation for their potential in enhancing immune responses against Leishmania infections. The evidence around the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is poor. Several topical treatments may be used for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Which treatments are effective depends on the strain, with topical paromomycin effective for L. major, L. tropica, L. mexicana, L. panamensis, and L. braziliensis. Pentamidine is effective for L. guyanensis. Oral fluconazole or itraconazole appears effective in L. major and L. tropica. There is limited evidence to support the use of heat therapy in cutaneous leishmaniasis as of 2015. As of 2018, no studies have determined the effect of oral nutritional supplements on visceral leishmaniasis being treated with anti-leishmanial drug therapy. For the reason, it is not known if nutritional supplements are ineffective (or effective). Further research including high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if supplements are helpful and if so, at what dose, to help people with VL who are undergoing treatment with anti-leishmanial medications. The Institute for OneWorld Health has reintroduced the drug paromomycin for the treatment of leishmaniasis, results which led to its approval as an orphan drug. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative is also actively facilitating the search for novel therapeutics. A treatment with paromomycin will cost about US$10. The drug had originally been identified in the 1950s but had been abandoned because it would not be profitable, as the disease mostly affects poor people. The Indian government approved paromomycin for sale in August 2006. By 2012 the World Health Organization had successfully negotiated with the manufacturers to achieve a reduced cost for liposomal amphotericin B, to US$18 a vial, but several vials are needed for treatment and it must be kept at a stable, cool temperature.","['skin sores', 'fever', 'weight loss', 'enlarged spleen or liver']","leishmaniasis skin sores, fever, weight loss, enlarged spleen or

Rodent abatement efforts and flood mitigation projects can also help to prevent it. Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by people who have a high risk of occupational exposure can prevent leptospirosis infections in most cases. There is no human vaccine suitable for worldwide use. Only a few countries, such as Cuba, Japan, France, and China, have approved inactivated vaccines with limited protective effects. Side effects such as nausea, injection site redness and swelling have been reported after the vaccine was injected. Since the immunity induced by one Leptospiraserovar is only protective against that specific one, trivalent vaccines have been developed. They do not confer long-lasting immunity to humans or animals. Vaccines for other animals are more widely available. Vaccination of livestock and domestic animals, particularly dogs and cattle, is an effective measure in preventing both animal illness and zoonotic transmission to humans. Doxycycline is given once a week as a prophylaxis and is effective in reducing the rate of leptospirosis infections amongst high-risk individuals in flood-prone areas. In one study, it reduced the number of leptospirosis cases in military personnel undergoing exercises in the jungles. In another study, it reduced the number of symptomatic cases after exposure to leptospirosis under heavy rainfall in endemic areas. The prevention of leptospirosis from environmental sources like contaminated waterways, soil, sewers, and agricultural fields is disinfection used by effective microorganisms, which is mixed with bokashi mudballs for the infected waterways & sewers. Most leptospiral cases resolve spontaneously. Early initiation of antibiotics may prevent the progression to severe disease. Therefore, in resource-limited settings, antibiotics can be started once leptospirosis is suspected after history taking and examination. For mild leptospirosis, antibiotic recommendations such as doxycycline, azithromycin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin were based solely on in vitro testing. In 2001, the WHO recommended oral doxycycline (2 mg/kg up to 100 mg every 12 hours) for five to seven days for those with mild leptospirosis. Tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin can also be used in such cases. However, in areas where both rickettsia and leptospirosis are endemic, azithromycin and doxycycline are the drugs of choice. Doxycycline is not used in cases where the patient suffers from liver damage as it has been linked to hepatotoxicity. Based on a 1988 study, intravenous (IV) benzylpenicillin (also known as penicillin G) is recommended for the treatment of severe leptospirosis. Intravenous benzylpenicillin (30 mg/kg up to 1.2 g every six hours) is used for five to seven days. Amoxicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin may also be used for severe cases. Ceftriaxone (1 g IV every 24 hours for seven days) is also effective for severe leptospirosis. Cefotaxime (1 g IV every six hours for seven days) and doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours for seven days) are equally effective as benzylpenicillin (1.5 million units IV every six hours for seven days). Therefore, there is no evidence on differences in death reduction when benzylpenicillin is compared with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Another study conducted in 2007 also showed no difference in efficacy between doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg orally every 12 hours for seven days) or azithromycin (2 g on day one followed by 1 g daily for two more days) for suspected leptospirosis. There was no difference in the resolution of fever, and azithromycin is better tolerated than doxycycline. Outpatients are given doxycycline or azithromycin. Doxycycline can shorten the duration of leptospirosis by two days, improve symptoms, and prevent the shedding of organisms in their urine. Azithromycin and amoxicillin are given to pregnant women and children. Rarely, a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction can develop in the first few hours after antibiotic administration. However, according to a meta-analysis done in 2012, the benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of leptospirosis was unclear, although the use of antibiotics may reduce the duration of illness by two to four days. Another meta-analysis done in 2013 reached a similar conclusion. For those with severe leptospirosis, including potassium wasting with high kidney output dysfunction, intravenous hydration and potassium supplements can prevent dehydration and hypokalemia. When acute kidney failure occurs, early initiation of haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can help to improve survival. For those with respiratory failure, tracheal intubation with low tidal volume improves survival rates. Corticosteroids have been proposed to suppress inflammation in leptospirosis because Leptospira infection can induce the release of chemical signals which promote inflammation of blood vessels in the lungs. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of corticosteroids is beneficial.","['fever', 'muscle aches', 'red eyes']","leptospirosis fever, muscle aches, red eyes fever,

initiation of haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can help to improve survival. for those with respiratory failure, tracheal intubation with low tidal volume improves survival rates. corticosteroids have been proposed to suppress inflammation in leptospirosis because leptospira infection can induce the release of chemical signals which promote inflammation of blood vessels in the lungs. however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of corticosteroids is beneficial."

Hydroxychloroquiine is associated with a 54% reduction in mortality due to SLE. It is recommended that all people with SLE be on hydroxychloroquine regardless of disease activity due to its well documented benefits, unless there are contraindications to its use. Contraindications to hydroxychloroquine include allergy to the medication or significant retinal disease (as hydroxychloroquine may worsen retinopathy). Regular eye exams are recommended for those on hydroxychloroquine chronically due to this rare risk. The prevalence of retinal toxicity for those on the medication was 2% at 10 years. Treatment can include corticosteroids and anti-malarial drugs. Certain types of lupus nephritis such as diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis require intermittent cytotoxic drugs.

Lyme Disease,,"Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is a tick-borne disease caused by species of Borrelia bacteria, transmitted by blood-feeding ticks in the genus Ixodes. It is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer.","Antibiotics are the primary treatment. The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns. Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. The standard treatment for cellulitis, cephalexin, is not useful for Lyme disease. When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, as these are effective against both infections. Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy, radiculopathy, meningitis, or peripheral neuropathy. Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. Treatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease, to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone. Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended, as no evidence shows it to be effective. IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. Facial palsy may resolve without treatment; however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. About a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. People with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping, should use crutches. Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy, or physical therapy. People receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it. Tick bites can be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. Most Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands, shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (""quest"") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. As a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. The EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET, picaridin, IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD). Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. After coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or a warm dryer is not enough). Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduces the risk of infection. Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister. The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair.",[],"lyme disease lyme disease, also known as

the wearer s skin. light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. military and outdoor workers uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80 95 . permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. the epa recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including deet, picaridin, ir3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (ole, a natural compound) and ole s active ingredient para-menthane-diol (pmd). unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. the most popular repellent is deet in the u.s. and picaridin in europe. unlike deet, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective against ticks, 20 picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55 98.11 deet for 5 6 hours or 30 40 ole for 6 hours. repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for ole or pmd). if sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. after coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or a warm dryer is not enough). showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduces the risk of infection. unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister. the following areas should be checked especially carefully armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair."
Lymphedema,"Swelling in arms or legs, feeling of heaviness or tightness","Lymphedema (USA), lymphœdema (UK) also known as lymphatic edema (US)/œdema (UK), is a condition of localized swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The lymphatic system functions as a critical portion of the body's immune system and returns interstitial fluid to the bloodstream. Lymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or parasitic infections, but it can also be seen in a number of genetic disorders.","Curative Treatment Curative treatment for lymphedema is surgical and relies on supermicrosurgery, which involves performing a lymph node graft from a healthy donor site to the diseased area. In simpler cases, a lymphatic-venous shunt allows excess lymph to be drained into adjacent superficial veins. These treatments are performed by surgeons specializing in microsurgery and result in improvement in 98% of cases. Complementary treatment may improve outcomes. This commonly include compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) and the use of an intermittent pneumatic compression pump, which together is known as combined decongestive therapy. MLD is most effective in mild to moderate disease. In breast cancer-related lymphedema, MLD is safe and may offer added benefit to compression bandages for reducing swelling. Most people with lymphedema can be medically managed with conservative treatment. Diuretics are not useful. Surgery is generally only used if symptoms are not improved by other measures.","['swelling in arms or legs', 'feeling of heaviness or tightness']","lymphedema swelling in arms or legs, feeling of heaviness or tightness lymphedema (usa), lymph dema (uk) also known as lymphatic edema (us)/ dema (uk), is a condition of localized swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. the lymphatic system functions as a critical portion of the body s immune system and returns interstitial fluid to the bloodstream. lymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or parasitic infections, but it can also be seen in a number of genetic disorders. curative treatment curative treatment for lymphedema is surgical and relies on supermicrosurgery, which involves performing a lymph node graft from a healthy donor site to the diseased area. in simpler cases, a lymphatic-venous shunt allows excess lymph to be drained into adjacent superficial veins. these treatments are performed by surgeons specializing in microsurgery and result in improvement in 98 of cases. complementary treatment may improve outcomes. this commonly include compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, manual lymphatic drainage (mld) and the use of an intermittent pneumatic compression pump, which together is known as combined decongestive therapy. mld is most effective in mild to moderate disease. in breast cancer-related lymphedema, mld is safe and may offer added benefit to compression bandages for reducing swelling. most people with lymphedema can be medically managed with conservative treatment. diuretics are not useful. surgery is generally only used if symptoms are not improved by other measures."

Malaria,"Periodic fever, chills, sweating","Periodic fever, chills, sweating. An infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites from the Plasmodium family that can be transmitted by the bite of the Anopheles mosquito or by a contaminated needle or transfusion. Falciparum malaria is the most deadly type.","Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. As of 2023, there are two malaria vaccines, approved for use in children by the WHO: RTS,S and R21. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high Anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas. Prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar programme in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget. In 2021, the World Health Organization confirmed that China has eliminated malaria. In 2023, the World Health Organization confirmed that Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Belize have eliminated malaria. In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have anaemia, which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation. Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications; the ones used depend on the type and severity of the disease, the patient's weight and other medical factors. While medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear. Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately. Programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever. Nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials.","['periodic fever', 'chills', 'sweating']","malaria periodic fever, chills, sweating periodic fever, chills, sweating. an infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites from the plasmodium family that can be transmitted by the bite of the anopheles mosquito or by a contaminated needle or transfusion. falciparum malaria is the most deadly type. methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. as of 2023, there are two malaria vaccines, approved for use in children by the who rts,s and r21. the presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. if any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in north america, europe, and parts of the middle east. however, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite s reproduction. furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas. prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world s poorest people. there is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. for example, in china whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the chinese provinces the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. in contrast, a similar programme in tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget. in 2021, the world health organization confirmed that china has eliminated malaria. in 2023, the world health organization confirmed that azerbaijan, tajikistan, and belize have eliminated malaria. in areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have anaemia, which is sometimes due to malaria. giving children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation. malaria is treated with antimalarial medications the ones used depend on the type and severity of the disease, the patient s weight and other medical factors. while medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear. providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately. programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever. nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials."

Specifically, it is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid antrum and mastoid air cell system inside the mastoid process. The mastoid process is the portion of the temporal bone of the skull that is behind the ear.","If ear infections are treated in a reasonable amount of time, the antibiotics will usually cure the infection and prevent its spread. For this reason, mastoiditis is rare in developed countries. Most ear infections occur in infants as the eustachian tubes are not fully developed and don't drain readily. In all developed countries with up-to-date modern healthcare the primary treatment for mastoiditis is administration of intravenous antibiotics. Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given, such as ceftriaxone. As culture results become available, treatment can be switched to more specific antibiotics directed at the eradication of the recovered aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Long-term antibiotics may be necessary to completely eradicate the infection. If the condition does not quickly improve with antibiotics, surgical procedures may be performed (while continuing the medication). The most common procedure is a myringotomy, a small incision in the tympanic membrane (eardrum), or the insertion of a tympanostomy tube into the eardrum. These serve to drain the pus from the middle ear, helping to treat the infection. The tube is extruded spontaneously after a few weeks to months, and the incision heals naturally.

Measles,,,"Mothers who are immune to measles pass antibodies to their children while they are still in the womb, especially if the mother acquired immunity through infection rather than vaccination. Such antibodies will usually give newborn infants some immunity against measles, but these antibodies are gradually lost over the course of the first nine months of life. However, immunization with live vaccines is not recommended in pregnancy; pregnant people found to be non-immune to measles should be immunized after delivery. Infants under one year of age whose maternal anti-measles antibodies have disappeared become susceptible to infection with the measles virus. It is generally recommended that children be immunized against measles at 12 months, as part of a three-part MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella). The vaccine is generally not given before this age because younger infants respond inadequately to the vaccine due to an immature immune system. A second dose of the vaccine is recommended between the ages of four and five, to increase rates of immunity. Adverse reactions to vaccination are rare, with fever and pain at the injection site being the most common. Life-threatening adverse reactions occur in less than one per million vaccinations (<0.0001%). In areas with a high risk of measles infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the first two doses of vaccine be given earlier, at nine and eighteen months of age. The vaccine should be given whether the child is HIV-infected or not. The vaccine is less effective in HIV-infected infants than in the general population, but early treatment with antiretroviral drugs can increase its effectiveness. Measles vaccination programs are often used to deliver other child health interventions as well, such as bed nets to protect against malaria, antiparasitic medicine, and vitamin A supplements, and so contribute to the reduction of child deaths from other causes. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all adult international travelers who do not have positive evidence of previous measles immunity receive two doses of MMR vaccine before traveling. Birth before 1957 is presumptive evidence of immunity. People born before 1957 are likely to have been naturally infected with the measles virus and generally need not be considered susceptible. There have been false claims of an association between the measles vaccine and autism; this incorrect concern has reduced the rate of vaccination and increased the number of cases of measles where immunization rates became too low to maintain herd immunity. Additionally, there have been false claims that measles infection protects against cancer. Administration of the MMR vaccine may prevent measles after exposure to the virus (post-exposure prophylaxis). Post-exposure prophylaxis guidelines are specific to jurisdiction and population. Passive immunization against measles by an intramuscular injection of antibodies could be effective up to the seventh day after exposure. Compared to no treatment, the risk of measles infection is reduced by 83%, and the risk of death by measles is reduced by 76%. However, the effectiveness of passive immunization in comparison to active measles vaccine is not clear. The MMR vaccine is 95% effective for preventing measles after one dose if the vaccine is given to a child who is twelve months of age or older; if a second dose of the MMR vaccine is given, it will provide immunity in 97-99% of children. There is no specific antiviral treatment if measles develops. Instead the medications are generally aimed at treating superinfections, maintaining good hydration with adequate fluids, and pain relief. Supportive treatment can include ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) to reduce fever and pain and, if required, a fast-acting medication to dilate the airways for cough. Some groups, such as young children and the severely malnourished, are also physician-administered vitamin A, which acts as an immunomodulator that boosts the antibody responses to measles and decreases the risk of serious complications. While vitamin A treatment does not cure the disease or reduce mortality in every age group, two doses (200,000 IU) of vitamin A was shown to reduce mortality in children younger than two years of age. In the 2025 U.S. outbreak, children are presenting at hospitals with measles and hypervitaminosis A because their parents were administering vitamin A sources (supplements or cod liver oil) as attempts of protection before the children became ill with measles.

Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that it interferes with your daily activities.","Management of migraine includes both prevention of migraine attacks and acute treatment. Preventive (prophylactic) treatment can be given in the absence of a headache to reduce the frequency and severity of future attacks. Acute (abortive) treatment attempts to diminish or reverse the progression of a headache that has already started. Measures for reducing and avoiding triggers may also be beneficial. Headache tracking, using a headache diary or smartphone app, is a standard self-management tool used to monitor migraineurs' frequency of headache occurrence, associated symptoms or triggers, and effects of treatments. A migraine management plan often includes lifestyle modifications to cope with migraine triggers and reduce the impact of comorbidities. Recommended lifestyle modifications promote maintaining a consistent lifestyle, through regular sleep patterns, regular eating, staying hydrated, managing stress, engaging in moderate exercise, and maintaining a healthy body weight. Avoiding dietary triggers and caffeine overuse may also be recommended lifestyle modifications. Data suggests that sleep modification may be particularly helpful in reducing migraine frequency for adults with chronic migraines. Behavioral techniques that have been utilized in the treatment of migraines include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), relaxation training, biofeedback, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), as well as mindfulness-based therapies. A 2024 systematic literature review and meta analysis found evidence that treatments such as CBT, relaxation training, ACT, and mindfulness-based therapies can reduce migraine frequency both on their own and in combination with other treatment options. In addition, it was found that relaxation therapy aided in the lessening of migraine frequency when compared to education by itself. Similarly, for children and adolescents, CBT and biofeedback strategies are effective in decreasing of frequency and intensity of migraines. These techniques often include relaxation methods and promotion of long-term management without medication side effects, which is emphasized for younger individuals. A variety of possible diets have been proposed, including ketogenic diet, Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and high intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and oil seeds. Further research is needed to examine whether and when dietary interventions are beneficial to migraineurs. Interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation require further research. Acute treatments are most effective when administered early in an attack. Initial recommended treatment for acute mild to moderate attacks is with over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol) for pain. Triptans are recommended as a first-line therapy for moderate to severe attacks. The approval of CGRP inhibitors (gepants) is seen as a major advance in migraine treatment. According to the American Headache Society, CGRP targeting therapies are a first-line option for migraine prevention. Anti-nausea medications are used as a second-line treatment for migraine-related nausea. Ergotamines may be used by those experiencing headaches that do not respond to over-the-counter pain medications. Opioids should not be prescribed, as higher doses of opioids are linked to medication overuse headache (MOH) and increased risk of progression from episodic to chronic migraines. Systematic review and network meta analysis comparing the effectiveness of medications for acute migraine attacks in adults suggest that triptans, ditans, and gepants are all associated with reduced pain after 2 hours, with triptans being the most successful in reducing pain. Gepants were the least likely to involve adverse events, with some triptans having a higher risk than gepants, and ditans having the highest risk among all treatments.

Mumps,"Swollen salivary glands (usually parotid), fever, headache, fatigue","Swollen cheeks, pain when chewing, mild fever. Mumps virus infection attacks the salivary glands.","Mumps is preventable with vaccination. Mumps vaccines use live attenuated viruses. Most countries include mumps vaccination in their immunization programs, and the MMR vaccine, which also protects against measles and rubella, is the most commonly used mumps vaccine. Mumps vaccination can also be done on its own and as a part of the MMRV vaccine, which also protects against measles, rubella, chickenpox, and shingles. More than 120 countries have adopted mumps vaccination, but coverage remains low in most African, South Asian, and Southeast Asian countries. In countries that have implemented mumps vaccination, significant declines in mumps cases and complications caused by infection such as encephalitis have been observed. Mumps vaccines are typically administered in early childhood, but may also be given in adolescence and adulthood if need be. Vaccination is expected to be capable of neutralizing wild-type MuVs, which are not included in the vaccine, since they do not appear to evade vaccine-derived immunity. A variety of virus strains have been used in mumps vaccines, including the Jeryl Lynn (JL), Leningrad-3, Leningrad-3-Zagreb (L-Zagreb), Rubini, and Urabe AM9 strains. Some other less prominent strains exist that are typically confined to individual countries. These include the Hoshino, Miyahara, Torii, and NK M-46 strains that have been produced in Japan and the S-12 strain, which is used by Iran. Mild adverse reactions are relatively common, including fever and rash, but aseptic meningitis also occurs at varying rates. Other rare adverse reactions include meningoencephalitis, parotitis, deafness from inner ear damage, orchitis, and pancreatitis. Safety and effectiveness vary by vaccine strain: Rubini is safe but because of its low effectiveness in outbreaks, its use has been abandoned. JL is relatively safe and has a relatively high effectiveness. However, the effectiveness is significantly lower in outbreaks. A modified version of JL vaccines is RIT 4385, which is also considered safe. Urabe and Leningrad-3 are both at least as effective as JL, but are less safe. L-Zagreb, a modified version of Leningrad-3, is considered safe and effective, including in outbreaks. Mumps protection from the MMR vaccine is higher after two doses than one and is estimated to be between 79% and 95%, lower than the degree of protection against measles and rubella. This, however, has still been sufficient to nearly eliminate mumps in countries that vaccinate against it as well as significantly reduce frequencies of complications among the vaccinated. If at least one dose is received, then hospitalization rates are reduced by an estimated 50% among the infected. Compared to the MMR vaccine, the MMRV vaccine appears to be less effective in terms of providing mumps protection. A difficulty in assessing vaccine effectiveness is that there is no clear correlate of immunity, so it is not possible to predict if a person has acquired immunity from the vaccine. There is a lack of data on the effectiveness of a third dose of the MMR vaccine. In an outbreak in which a third dose was administered, it was unclear if it had any effect on reducing disease incidence, and it only appeared to boost antibodies in those who previously had little or no antibodies to mumps. Contraindications for mumps vaccines include prior allergic reaction to any ingredients or to neomycin, pregnancy, immunosuppression, a moderate or severe illness, having received a blood product recently, and, for MMRV vaccines specifically, a personal or familial history of seizures. It is also advised that women not become pregnant in the four weeks after MMR vaccination. No effective prophylaxis exists for mumps after one has been exposed to the virus, so vaccination or receiving immunoglobulin after exposure does not prevent progression to illness. For people who are infected or suspected to be infected, isolation is important in preventing the spread of the disease. This includes abstaining from school, childcare, work, and other settings in which people gather together. In healthcare settings, it is recommended that healthcare workers use precautions such as face masks to reduce the likelihood of infection and to abstain from work if they develop mumps. Additional measures taken in health care facilities include reducing wait times for mumps patients, having mumps patients wear masks, and cleaning and disinfecting areas that mumps patients use. The virus can be inactivated using formalin, ether, chloroform, heat, or ultraviolet light. Mumps is usually self-limiting, and no specific antiviral treatments exist for it, so treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms and preventing complications. Non-medicinal ways to manage the disease include bed rest, using ice or heat packs on the neck and scrotum, consuming more fluids, eating soft food, and gargling with warm salt water. Anti-fever medications may be used during the febrile period, excluding aspirin when given to children, which may cause Reye syndrome. Analgesics may also be provided to control pain from mumps inflammatory conditions. For seizures, anticonvulsants may be used. In severe neurological cases, ventilators may be used to support breathing. Intramuscular mumps immunoglobulin may be of benefit when administered early in some cases, but it has not shown benefit in outbreaks. Although not recommended, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may reduce the rates of some complications. Antibiotics may be used as a precaution in cases in which bacterial infection cannot be ruled out as well as to prevent secondary bacterial infection. Autoimmune-based disorders connected to mumps are treatable with intravenous immunoglobulin. Various types of treatment for mumps orchitis have been used, but no specific treatment is recommended due to each method's limitations. These measures are primarily based on relieving testicular pain and reducing intratesticular pressure to reduce the likelihood of testicular atrophy. Interferon-α2α interferes with viral replication, so it has been postulated to be useful in preventing testicular damage and infertility. Interferon alfa-2b may reduce the duration of symptoms and incidence of complications. In cases of hydrocele formation, excess fluid can be removed. Acupuncture has been used fairly widely in China to treat children who have mumps, however, no high-quality trials have been conducted to determine the safety or effectiveness of this treatment approach.","['swollen salivary glands (usually parotid)', 'fever', 'headache', 'fatigue']","mumps swollen salivary glands (usually parotid), fever, headache, fatigue swollen cheeks, pain when chewing,

strain rubini is safe but because of its low effectiveness in outbreaks, its use has been abandoned. jl is relatively safe and has a relatively high effectiveness. however, the effectiveness is significantly lower in outbreaks. a modified version of jl vaccines is rit 4385, which is also considered safe. urabe and leningrad-3 are both at least as effective as jl, but are less safe. l-zagreb, a modified version of leningrad-3, is considered safe and effective, including in outbreaks. mumps protection from the mmr vaccine is higher after two doses than one and is estimated to be between 79 and 95 , lower than the degree of protection against measles and rubella. this, however, has still been sufficient to nearly eliminate mumps in countries that vaccinate against it as well as significantly reduce frequencies of complications among the vaccinated. if at least one dose is received, then hospitalization rates are reduced by an estimated 50 among the infected. compared to the mmr vaccine, the mmrv vaccine appears to be less effective in terms of providing mumps protection. a difficulty in assessing vaccine effectiveness is that there is no clear correlate of immunity, so it is not possible to predict if a person has acquired immunity from the vaccine. there is a lack of data on the effectiveness of a third dose of the mmr vaccine. in an outbreak in which a third dose was administered, it was unclear if it had any effect on reducing disease incidence, and it only appeared to boost antibodies in those who previously had little or no antibodies to mumps. contraindications for mumps vaccines include prior allergic reaction to any ingredients or to neomycin, pregnancy, immunosuppression, a moderate or severe illness, having received a blood product recently, and, for mmrv vaccines specifically, a personal or familial history of seizures. it is also advised that women not become pregnant in the four weeks after mmr vaccination. no effective prophylaxis exists for mumps after one has been exposed to the virus, so vaccination or receiving immunoglobulin after exposure does not prevent progression to illness. for people who are infected or suspected to be infected, isolation is important in preventing the spread of the disease. this includes abstaining from school, childcare, work, and other settings in which people gather together. in healthcare settings, it is recommended that healthcare workers use precautions such as face masks to reduce the likelihood of infection and to abstain from work if they develop mumps. additional measures taken in health care facilities include reducing wait times for mumps patients, having mumps patients wear masks, and cleaning and disinfecting areas that mumps patients use. the virus can be inactivated using formalin, ether, chloroform, heat, or ultraviolet light. mumps is usually self-limiting, and no specific antiviral treatments exist for it, so treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms and preventing complications. non-medicinal ways to manage the disease include bed rest, using ice or heat packs on the neck and scrotum, consuming more fluids, eating soft food, and gargling with warm salt water. anti-fever medications may be used during the febrile period, excluding aspirin when given to children, which may cause reye syndrome. analgesics may also be provided to control pain from mumps inflammatory conditions. for seizures, anticonvulsants may be used. in severe neurological cases, ventilators may be used to support breathing. intramuscular mumps immunoglobulin may be of benefit when administered early in some cases, but it has not shown benefit in outbreaks. although not recommended, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may reduce the rates of some complications. antibiotics may be used as a precaution in cases in which bacterial infection cannot be ruled out as well as to prevent secondary bacterial infection. autoimmune-based disorders connected to mumps are treatable with intravenous immunoglobulin. various types of treatment for mumps orchitis have been used, but no specific treatment is recommended due to each method s limitations. these measures are primarily based on relieving testicular pain and reducing intratesticular pressure to reduce the likelihood of testicular atrophy. interferon- 2 interferes with viral replication, so it has been postulated to be useful in preventing testicular damage and infertility. interferon alfa-2b may reduce the duration of symptoms and incidence of complications. in cases of hydrocele formation, excess fluid can be removed. acupuncture has been used fairly widely in china to treat children who have mumps, however, no high-quality trials have been conducted to determine the safety or effectiveness of this treatment approach."

Myelodysplastic Syndrome,"Fatigue, frequent infections, easy bruising or bleeding","A myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is one of a group of cancers in which blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature, and as a result, do not develop into healthy blood cells. Early on, no symptoms are typically seen. Later, symptoms may include fatigue, shortness of breath, bleeding disorders, anemia, or frequent infections.","The goals of therapy are to control symptoms, improve quality of life, improve overall survival, and decrease progression to AML. The IPSS scoring system can help guide therapy for patients with MDS. In those with low risk MDS (designated by an IPSS score less than 3.5), no disease specific treatment has been found to be helpful and treatment is focused on supportive care by maintaining blood counts. Erythrostimulating agents such as darbepoetin alfa or erythropoietin may be used to raise the red blood cell count. The mean duration of response to erythrostimulating agents is 8-23 months, and the response rate is about 39% (with a response defined as a 1 mg/dL rise in the hemoglobin level or a person not requiring a transfusion). Romiplostim and eltrombopag are thrombopoietin receptor agonists which act on megakaryocytes (platelet precursor cells) to increase platelet production. They are used to increase platelet counts and have been shown to reduce the need for platelet transfusions. However, the two drugs increase the risk of progression to AML, so they are not used in MDS with excess blasts. For those with high risk MDS (characterized by an IPSS score greater than 3.5), the hypomethylating agent azacitidine showed increased survival compared to standard care (supportive care, cytarabine or chemotherapy) and is considered the standard of care. Azacitidine had increased survival (24 months vs 15 months) and higher rates of partial or complete therapeutic response (29% vs 12%) as compared to conventional care. The hypomethylating agent decitabine has shown a similar survival benefit to azacitidine and has a response rate as high as 43%. Decitabine is available in combination with cedazuridine as Decitabine/cedazuridine (Inqovi) is a fixed-dosed combination medication for the treatment of adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Lenalidomide is effective in reducing red blood cell transfusion requirement in patients with the chromosome 5q deletion subtype (5q- syndrome) of MDS, and the median duration of response is greater than 2 years. Luspatercept is a TGFβ ligand that acts to decrease SMAD2 and SMAD3 signaling involved in erythropoeisis and may be used in MDS with anemia that is not responsive to erythrocyte-stimulating agents or mild MDS with ring sideroblasts. Luspatercept was shown to decrease the need for transfusions, and this effect lasted for a median of 30.6 weeks. HLA-matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation, particularly in younger (i.e., less than 40 years of age) and more severely affected patients, offers the potential for curative therapy. The success of bone marrow transplantation has been found to correlate with severity of MDS as determined by the IPSS score, with patients having a more favorable IPSS score tend to have a more favorable outcome with transplantation.","['fatigue', 'frequent infections', 'easy bruising or bleeding']","myelodysplastic syndrome fatigue, frequent infections, easy bruising or bleeding a myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) is one of a group of cancers in which blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature, and as a result, do not develop into healthy blood cells. early on, no symptoms are typically seen. later, symptoms may include fatigue, shortness of breath, bleeding disorders, anemia, or frequent infections. the goals of therapy are to control symptoms, improve quality of life, improve overall survival, and decrease progression to aml. the ipss scoring system can help guide therapy for patients with mds. in those with low risk mds (designated by an ipss score less than 3.5), no disease specific treatment has been found to be helpful and treatment is focused on supportive care by maintaining blood counts. erythrostimulating agents such as darbepoetin alfa or erythropoietin may be used to raise the red blood cell count. the mean duration of response to erythrostimulating agents is 8-23 months, and the response rate is about 39 (with a response defined as a 1 mg/dl rise in the hemoglobin level or a person not requiring a transfusion). romiplostim and eltrombopag are thrombopoietin receptor agonists which act on megakaryocytes (platelet precursor cells) to increase platelet production. they are used to increase platelet counts and have been shown to reduce the need for platelet transfusions. however, the two drugs increase the risk of progression to aml, so they are not used in mds with excess blasts. for those with high risk mds (characterized by an ipss score greater than 3.5), the hypomethylating agent azacitidine showed increased survival compared to standard care (supportive care, cytarabine or chemotherapy) and is considered the standard of care. azacitidine had increased survival (24 months vs 15 months) and higher rates of partial or complete therapeutic response (29 vs 12 ) as compared to conventional care. the hypomethylating agent decitabine has shown a similar survival benefit to azacitidine and has a response rate as high as 43 . decitabine is available in combination with cedazuridine as decitabine/cedazuridine (inqovi) is a fixed-dosed combination medication for the treatment of adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml). lenalidomide is effective in reducing red blood cell transfusion requirement in patients with the chromosome 5q deletion subtype (5q- syndrome) of mds, and the median duration of response is greater than 2 years. luspatercept is a tgf ligand that acts to decrease smad2 and smad3 signaling involved in erythropoeisis and may be used in mds with anemia that is not responsive to erythrocyte-stimulating agents or mild mds with ring sideroblasts. luspatercept was shown to decrease the need for transfusions, and this effect lasted for a median of 30.6 weeks. hla-matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation, particularly in younger (i.e., less than 40 years of age) and more severely affected patients, offers the potential for curative therapy. the success of bone marrow transplantation has been found to correlate with severity of mds as determined by the ipss score, with patients having a more favorable ipss score tend to have a more favorable outcome with transplantation."

Myoclonus,"Sudden, brief muscle contractions or jerks, often affecting the arms, legs, or face","Myoclonus is a brief, involuntary, irregular (lacking rhythm) twitching of a muscle, a joint, or a group of muscles, different from clonus, which is rhythmic or regular. Myoclonus (myo- ""muscle"", clonus ""spasm"") describes a medical sign and, generally, is not a diagnosis of a disease. It belongs to the hyperkinetic movement disorders, among tremor and chorea for example.","Symptomatic treatment may be made. Combinations of drugs may be used to control myoclonus. Concerning more serious conditions, the complex origins of myoclonus may be treated with multiple drugs, which have a limited effect individually, but greater when combined with others that act on different brain pathways or mechanisms. Treatment is most effective when the underlying cause is known, and can be treated as such. Some drugs being studied in different combinations include clonazepam, sodium valproate, piracetam, and primidone. Hormonal therapy may improve responses to antimyoclonic drugs in some people. Some studies have shown that doses of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) leads to improvement in patients with some types of action myoclonus and PME. These differences in the effect of 5-HTP on patients with myoclonus have not yet been explained. Many of the drugs used for myoclonus, such as barbiturates, phenytoin and primidone, are also used to treat epilepsy. Barbiturates slow down the central nervous system and cause tranquilizing or antiseizure effects. Phenytoin and primidone are effective antiepileptics drugs, although phenytoin can cause liver failure or have other harmful long-term effects in patients with PME. Sodium valproate is an alternative therapy for myoclonus and can be used either alone or in combination with clonazepam. Some people have adverse reactions to clonazepam and/or sodium valproate. When patients are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus and treatment of metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes this leads to the mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug. In forms of myoclonus where only a single area is affected, and even in a few other various forms, Botox injections (OnabotulinumtoxinA) may be helpful. The chemical messenger responsible for triggering the involuntary muscle contractions is blocked by the Botulinum toxins of the Botox. Surgery is also a viable option for treatment if the symptoms are caused by a tumor or lesion in the brain or spinal cord. Surgery may also correct symptoms in those where myoclonus affects parts of the face or ear. While DBS is still being studied for use with myoclonus, Deep Brain Stimulation has also been tried in those with this and other movement disorders.","['sudden', 'brief muscle contractions or jerks', 'often affecting the arms', 'legs', 'or face']","myoclonus sudden, brief muscle contractions or jerks, often affecting the arms, legs, or face myoclonus is a brief, involuntary, irregular (lacking rhythm) twitching of a muscle, a joint, or a group of muscles, different from clonus, which is rhythmic or regular. myoclonus (myo- muscle , clonus spasm ) describes a medical sign and, generally, is not a diagnosis of a disease. it belongs to the hyperkinetic movement disorders, among tremor and chorea for example. symptomatic treatment may be made. combinations of drugs may be used to control myoclonus. concerning more serious conditions, the complex origins of myoclonus may be treated with multiple drugs, which have a limited effect individually, but greater when combined with others that act on different brain pathways or mechanisms. treatment is most effective when the underlying cause is known, and can be treated as such. some drugs being studied in different combinations include clonazepam, sodium valproate, piracetam, and primidone. hormonal therapy may improve responses to antimyoclonic drugs in some people. some studies have shown that doses of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-htp) leads to improvement in patients with some types of action myoclonus and pme. these differences in the effect of 5-htp on patients with myoclonus have not yet been explained. many of the drugs used for myoclonus, such as barbiturates, phenytoin and primidone, are also used to treat epilepsy. barbiturates slow down the central nervous system and cause tranquilizing or antiseizure effects. phenytoin and primidone are effective antiepileptics drugs, although phenytoin can cause liver failure or have other harmful long-term effects in patients with pme. sodium valproate is an alternative therapy for myoclonus and can be used either alone or in combination with clonazepam. some people have adverse reactions to clonazepam and/or sodium valproate. when patients are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus and treatment of metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. when pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. sometimes this leads to the mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. the beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug. in forms of myoclonus where only a single area is affected, and even in a few other various forms, botox injections (onabotulinumtoxina) may be helpful. the chemical messenger responsible for triggering the involuntary muscle contractions is blocked by the botulinum toxins of the botox. surgery is also a viable option for treatment if the symptoms are caused by a tumor or lesion in the brain or spinal cord. surgery may also correct symptoms in those where myoclonus affects parts of the face or ear. while dbs is still being studied for use with myoclonus, deep brain stimulation has also been tried in those with this and other movement disorders."

Neuralgia,"Sharp, shooting pain along the affected nerve","Neuralgia (Greek neuron, ""nerve"" + algos, ""pain"") is pain in the distribution of a nerve or nerves, as in intercostal neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. == Classification == Under the general heading of neuralgia are trigeminal neuralgia (TN), atypical trigeminal neuralgia (ATN), occipital neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia and postherpetic neuralgia (caused by shingles or herpes). The term neuralgia is also used to refer to pain associated with sciatica and brachial plexopathy.","Treatment options include medicines and surgery. Neuralgia is more difficult to treat than other types of pain because it does not respond well to normal pain medications. Special medications have become more specific to neuralgia and typically fall under the category of membrane stabilizing drugs or antidepressants such as duloxetine (Cymbalta). The antiepileptic medication pregabalin (Lyrica) was developed specifically for neuralgia and other neuropathic pain as a successor to gabapentin (Neurontin). High doses of anticonvulsant medicines—used to block nerve firing— and tricyclic antidepressants are generally effective in treating neuralgia. If medication fails to relieve pain or produces intolerable side effects, surgical treatment may be recommended. Neural augmentative surgeries are used to stimulate the affected nerve. By stimulating the nerve the brain can be ""fooled"" into thinking it is receiving normal input. Electrodes are carefully placed in the dorsal root and subcutaneous nerve stimulation is used to stimulate the targeted nerve pathway. A technician can create different electrical distributions in the nerve to optimize the efficiency, and a patient controls the stimulation by passing a magnet over the unit. Some degree of facial numbness is expected after most of these surgical procedures, and neuralgia might return despite the procedure's initial success. Depending on the procedure, other surgical risks include hearing loss, balance problems, infection, and stroke. These surgeries include rhizotomy (where select nerve fibers are destroyed to block pain) and microvascular decompression (where the surgeon moves the vessels that are compressing the nerve away from it and places a soft cushion between the nerve and the vessels).","['sharp', 'shooting pain along the affected nerve']","neuralgia sharp, shooting pain along the affected nerve neuralgia (greek neuron, nerve algos, pain ) is pain in the distribution of a nerve or nerves, as in intercostal neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. classification under the general heading of neuralgia are trigeminal neuralgia (tn), atypical trigeminal neuralgia (atn), occipital neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia and postherpetic neuralgia (caused by shingles or herpes). the term neuralgia is also used to refer to pain associated with sciatica and brachial plexopathy. treatment options include medicines and surgery. neuralgia is more difficult to treat than other types of pain because it does not respond well to normal pain medications. special medications have become more specific to neuralgia and typically fall under the category of membrane stabilizing drugs or antidepressants such as duloxetine (cymbalta). the antiepileptic medication pregabalin (lyrica) was developed specifically for neuralgia and other neuropathic pain as a successor to gabapentin (neurontin). high doses of anticonvulsant medicines used to block nerve firing and tricyclic antidepressants are generally effective in treating neuralgia. if medication fails to relieve pain or produces intolerable side effects, surgical treatment may be recommended. neural augmentative surgeries are used to stimulate the affected nerve. by stimulating the nerve the brain can be fooled into thinking it is receiving normal input. electrodes are carefully placed in the dorsal root and subcutaneous nerve stimulation is used to stimulate the targeted nerve pathway. a technician can create different electrical distributions in the nerve to optimize the efficiency, and a patient controls the stimulation by passing a magnet over the unit. some degree of facial numbness is expected after most of these surgical procedures, and neuralgia might return despite the procedure s initial success. depending on the procedure, other surgical risks include hearing loss, balance problems, infection, and stroke. these surgeries include rhizotomy (where select nerve fibers are destroyed to block pain) and microvascular decompression (where the surgeon moves the vessels that are compressing the nerve away from it and places a soft cushion between the nerve and the vessels)."

Omphalitis,"Redness, swelling, discharge, foul odor around the umbilical area","Omphalitis of newborn is the medical term for inflammation of the umbilical cord stump in the neonatal newborn period, most commonly attributed to a bacterial infection. Typically immediately after an infant is born, the umbilical cord is cut with a small remnant (often referred to as the stump) left behind. Normally the stump separates from the skin within 3–45 days after birth.","During the 1950s there were outbreaks of omphalitis that then led to anti-bacterial treatment of the umbilical cord stump as the new standard of care. It was later determined that in developed countries keeping the cord dry is sufficient, (known as ""dry cord care"") as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The umbilical cord dries more quickly and separates more readily when exposed to air However, each hospital/birthing center has its own recommendations for care of the umbilical cord after delivery. Some recommend not using any medicinal washes on the cord. Other popular recommendations include triple dye, betadine, bacitracin, or silver sulfadiazine. With regards to the medicinal treatments, there is little data to support any one treatment (or lack thereof) over another. However one recent review of many studies supported the use of chlorhexidine treatment as a way to reduce risk of death by 23% and risk of omphalitis by anywhere between 27 and 56% in community settings in underdeveloped countries. This study also found that this treatment increased the time that it would take for the umbilical stump to separate or fall off by 1.7 days. Lastly this large review also supported the notion that in hospital settings no medicinal type of cord care treatment was better at reducing infections compared to dry cord care. Treatment consists of antibiotic therapy aimed at the typical bacterial pathogens in addition to supportive care for any complications which might result from the infection itself such as hypotension or respiratory failure.

Osteoporosis,"Fragile bones, loss of height over time, back pain, fractures","Tulang rapuh, sering patah, nyeri punggung. Bone loss due to lack of calcium or vitamin D.","Lifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is, in many aspects, the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it. In people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis and increases bone density. The diet must ensure optimal calcium intake (of at least one gram daily), and measuring vitamin D levels is recommended, and taking specific supplements if necessary. Osteoporosis can affect nearly 1 in 3 women, and the bone loss is the most rapid within the first 2–3 years after menopause. This can be prevented by menopause hormone therapy, or MHT, which is meant to prevent bone loss and the degradation of the bone microarchitecture and is noted to reduce the risk of fractures in bones by 20-30%. However, MHT has been linked to safety concerns, so it is not generally recommended. As far as management goes with this potentially limiting disease, some practices can and should be implemented within the daily lifestyle. For example, it would be beneficial if the individual with osteoporosis refrained from consuming excess alcohol and avoided smoking. These individuals should also be intentional about intaking an adequate amount of protein, calcium, and vitamin D. If the woman has an even higher risk of fracture, managing this may require therapy. Generally, the recommended treatment to prevent a decrease in bone mineral density is physical activity. Exercise is sometimes the best medicine. Resistance training is the most recommended method of physical activity, but that can come in multiple forms. High intensity and high impact training is shown to be extremely beneficial in improving bone health and the most effective in improving, maintaining bone density in the lower spine and femur. Although these types of exercises are safe for postmenopausal women, there may still be a need for supervision and precautionary measures.","['fragile bones', 'loss of height over time', 'back pain', 'fractures']","osteoporosis fragile bones, loss of height over time, back pain, fractures tulang rapuh, sering patah, nyeri punggung. bone loss due to lack of calcium or vitamin d. lifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is, in many aspects, the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. as tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it. in people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis and increases bone density. the diet must ensure optimal calcium intake (of at least one gram daily), and measuring vitamin d levels is recommended, and taking specific supplements if necessary. osteoporosis can affect nearly 1 in 3 women, and the bone loss is the most rapid within the first 2 3 years after menopause. this can be prevented by menopause hormone therapy, or mht, which is meant to prevent bone loss and the degradation of the bone microarchitecture and is noted to reduce the risk of fractures in bones by 20-30 . however, mht has been linked to safety concerns, so it is not generally recommended. as far as management goes with this potentially limiting disease, some practices can and should be implemented within the daily lifestyle. for example, it would be beneficial if the individual with osteoporosis refrained from consuming excess alcohol and avoided smoking. these individuals should also be intentional about intaking an adequate amount of protein, calcium, and vitamin d. if the woman has an even higher risk of fracture, managing this may require therapy. generally, the recommended treatment to prevent a decrease in bone mineral density is physical activity. exercise is sometimes the best medicine. resistance training is the most recommended method of physical activity, but that can come in multiple forms. high intensity and high impact training is shown to be extremely beneficial in improving bone health and the most effective in improving, maintaining bone density in the lower spine and femur. although these types of exercises are safe for postmenopausal women, there may still be a need for supervision and precautionary measures."

Ovarian Cancer,,"Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor of an ovary. It may originate from the ovary itself or more commonly from communicating nearby structures such as fallopian tubes or the inner lining of the abdomen. The ovary is made up of three different cell types including epithelial cells, germ cells, and stromal cells.","Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied. Because a large fraction of ovarian cancers originate in the fallopian tubes, the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology now recommend that women who are not planning on having additional children and who are undergoing surgical procedures such as tubal ligation (having one's ""tubes tied"") undergo opportunistic salpingectomy — i.e. simultaneously having their fallopian tubes removed. OVCARE — BC Cancer's multi-institutional and multidisciplinary ovarian research group — began recommending salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy and in place of tubal ligation in 2010. Women with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a genetic counselor to see if testing for BRCA mutations would be beneficial. The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk. There may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments. Endometriosis has been linked to ovarian cancers. Human papillomavirus infection, smoking, and talc have not been identified as increasing the risk for developing ovarian cancer. Once it is determined that ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer is present, treatment is scheduled by a gynecologic oncologist (a physician trained to treat cancers of a woman's reproductive system). Gynecologic oncologists can perform surgery on and give chemotherapy to women with ovarian cancer. A treatment plan is developed. Treatment usually involves surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy, regardless of the subtype of ovarian cancer. Surgical treatment may be sufficient for well-differentiated malignant tumors and confined to the ovary. Addition of chemotherapy may be required for more aggressive tumors confined to the ovary. For patients with advanced disease, a combination of surgical reduction with a combination chemotherapy regimen is standard. Since 1980, platinum-based drugs have had an important role in treating ovarian cancer. Borderline tumors, even following spread outside of the ovary, are managed well with surgery, and chemotherapy is not seen as useful.

Ovarian Cyst,"Lower abdominal pain, irregular menstruation","Nyeri perut bawah, menstruasi tidak teratur. Fluid-filled sacs in the ovaries.","Most ovarian cysts occur naturally and go away in a few months without needing any treatment. In general, there are three options for dealing with an ovarian cyst: watchful waiting (e.g., waiting to see whether symptoms resolve on their own), additional imaging or investigation (e.g., getting an ultrasound later to see whether the cyst is growing), and surgery (e.g., surgical removal of the cyst). Cysts associated with hypothyroidism or other endocrine problems are managed by treating the underlying condition. About 95% of ovarian cysts are benign (not cancerous). Functional cysts and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts usually resolve spontaneously within one or two menstrual cycles. However, the bigger an ovarian cyst is, the less likely it is to disappear on its own. Treatment may be required if cysts persist over several months, grow, or cause increasing pain.

Panic Attack,"Chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations",,"Panic disorder is usually effectively managed with a variety of interventions, including pharmacological treatment with medication, and psychological therapies. The focus on management of panic disorder involves reducing the frequency and intensity of panic attacks, reducing anticipatory anxiety and agoraphobia, and achieving full remission. Most panic attacks will resolve spontaneously within a course of 20 to 30 minutes without interference. However, benzodiazepines, specifically alprazolam and clonazepam, are frequently prescribed for panic disorder due to their quick onset of action and good tolerability. But because they take about 45 minutes to start working, they are not usually effective for ending a current, on-going attack. However, when clonazepam (which has a long half-life) is taken every 12 hours at a proper dose, it can prevent new panic attacks from starting. Additionally, deep breathing techniques and relaxation can be used and are occasionally found to be helpful while the person is experiencing a panic attack or immediately after as a way to calm oneself. Some maintaining causes include avoidance of panic-provoking situations or environments, anxious or negative self-talk (""what-if"" thinking), mistaken beliefs (e.g., thinking one's symptoms are harmful or dangerous), and withheld feelings. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Clonazepam (every 12 hours) may have the most complete and longest duration of effect, followed by specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and CBT. Some research suggests that CBT is more effective at gaining coping skills than at effecting true panic cessation. A 2009 review found positive results from therapy and medication and a much better result when the two were combined. Even though there are modern medications to make short-term benefits to the patients life, long-term medication for panic disorder is not always utilized.

Parathyroid Adenoma,"Fatigue, weakness, bone pain, frequent urination, kidney stones",A parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland. It generally causes hyperparathyroidism; there are very few reports of parathyroid adenomas that were not associated with hyperparathyroidism. A human being usually has four parathyroid glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid in the neck.,"Surgery is the only cure for parathyroid adenomas. It is successful about 95% of the time. Parathyroidectomy is the removal of the affected gland(s). The standard of treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism was formerly a surgical technique called bilateral neck exploration, in which the neck was opened on both sides, the parathyroids were identified, and the affected tissue was removed. By the 1980s, unilateral exploration became more common. Parathyroidectomy can now be performed in a minimally invasive fashion, mainly because imaging techniques can pinpoint the location of the tissue. Minimally invasive techniques include smaller open procedures, radio-guided and video-assisted procedures, and totally endoscopic surgery. Before surgery is attempted, the affected glandular tissue must be located. Though the parathyroid glands are usually located on the back of the thyroid, their position is variable. Some people have one or more parathyroid glands elsewhere in the neck anatomy or in the chest. About 10% of parathyroid adenomas are ectopic, located not along the back of the thyroid but elsewhere in the body, sometimes in the mediastinum of the chest. This can make them difficult to locate, so various imaging techniques are used, such as the sestamibi scan, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), ultrasound, MRI, and CT scans. sometimes parathyroid adenomas can be ablated by ethanol injection, laser or radiofrequency guided by ultrasound.","['fatigue', 'weakness', 'bone pain', 'frequent urination', 'kidney stones']","parathyroid adenoma fatigue, weakness, bone pain, frequent urination, kidney stones a parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland. it generally causes hyperparathyroidism there are very few reports of parathyroid adenomas that were not associated with hyperparathyroidism. a human being usually has four parathyroid glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid in the neck. surgery is the only cure for parathyroid adenomas. it is successful about 95 of the time. parathyroidectomy is the removal of the affected gland(s). the standard of treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism was formerly a surgical technique called bilateral neck exploration, in which the neck was opened on both sides, the parathyroids were identified, and the affected tissue was removed. by the 1980s, unilateral exploration became more common. parathyroidectomy can now be performed in a minimally invasive fashion, mainly because imaging techniques can pinpoint the location of the tissue. minimally invasive techniques include smaller open procedures, radio-guided and video-assisted procedures, and totally endoscopic surgery. before surgery is attempted, the affected glandular tissue must be located. though the parathyroid glands are usually located on the back of the thyroid, their position is variable. some people have one or more parathyroid glands elsewhere in the neck anatomy or in the chest. about 10 of parathyroid adenomas are ectopic, located not along the back of the thyroid but elsewhere in the body, sometimes in the mediastinum of the chest. this can make them difficult to locate, so various imaging techniques are used, such as the sestamibi scan, single-photon emission computed tomography (spect), ultrasound, mri, and ct scans. sometimes parathyroid adenomas can be ablated by ethanol injection, laser or radiofrequency guided by ultrasound."

The risk of contracting pelvic inflammatory disease can be reduced by the following: Using barrier methods such as condoms; see human sexual behaviour for other listings. Using latex condoms to prevent STIs that may go untreated. Seeking medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms of PID. Using hormonal combined contraceptive pills also helps in reducing the chances of PID by thickening the cervical mucosal plug & hence preventing the ascent of causative organisms from the lower genital tract. Seeking medical attention after learning that a current or former sex partner has, or might have had a sexually transmitted infection. Getting an STI history from your current partner and strongly encouraging them to be tested and treated before intercourse. Diligence in avoiding vaginal activity, particularly intercourse, after the end of a pregnancy (delivery, miscarriage, or abortion) or certain gynecological procedures, to ensure that the cervix closes. Reducing the number of sexual partners; As in sexual monogamy. Avoiding the use of a douche that can upset the natural vaginal microbiota balance. Treatment is often started without confirmation of infection because of the serious complications that may result from delayed treatment. Treatment depends on the infectious agent and generally involves the use of antibiotic therapy although there is no clear evidence of which antibiotic regimen is more effective and safe in the management of PID. If there is no improvement within two to three days, the patient is typically advised to seek further medical attention. Hospitalization sometimes becomes necessary if there are other complications. Treating sexual partners for possible STIs can help in treatment and prevention. There should be no wait for STI results to start treatment. Treatment should not be avoided for longer than 2-3 days due to the risk of infertility. For women with PID of mild to moderate severity, parenteral and oral therapies appear to be effective.

Peritonitis,"Severe abdominal pain, tenderness, bloating, fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, increased heart rate","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender.","Depending on the severity of the person's state, the management of peritonitis may include: Antibiotics are usually administered intravenously, but they may also be infused directly into the peritoneum. The empiric choice of broad-spectrum antibiotics often consist of multiple drugs, and should be targeted against the most likely agents, depending on the cause of peritonitis (see above); once one or more agents grow in cultures isolated, therapy will be targeted against them. Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms must be covered. Out of the cephalosporins, cefoxitin and cefotetan can be used to cover Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria. Beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors can also be used; examples include ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ticarcillin/clavulanate. Carbapenems are also an option when treating primary peritonitis as all of the carbapenems cover Gram-positives, Gram-negatives, and anaerobes except for ertapenem. The only fluoroquinolone that can be used is moxifloxacin because this is the only fluoroquinolone that covers anaerobes. Tigecycline is a tetracycline that can be used due to its coverage of Gram-positives and Gram-negatives. Empiric therapy will often require multiple drugs from different classes.

Pilonidal Cyst,"Pain or discomfort in the tailbone area, swelling, redness, drainage of pus or blood, abscess formation","Pilonidal disease is a type of skin infection that typically occurs as a cyst between the cheeks of the buttocks and often at the upper end. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, and redness. There may also be drainage of fluid, but rarely a fever.","If there is an infection, treatment is generally by incision and drainage just off the midline because incisions in the midline have a hard time healing well. Following five simple rules has been known to prevent recurring inflammations for some people and avoid surgery: 1. Avoiding chairs and car seats that put pressure on the coccyx; 2. Being of average weight, preferably with low BMI; 3. Keeping the area clean; 4. Keeping the area dry by wearing exclusively cotton garments; 5. Keeping the area completely hair-free, for example, by regularly using an IPL hair removal device. The evidence for elective treatment of pilonidal sinus disease is poor. The most commonly performed surgery is for the pilonidal sinus complex to be surgically excised with the wound often left open to heal. Post-surgical wound packing may be necessary, and packing typically must be replaced daily for four to eight weeks. In some cases, two years may be required for complete granulation to occur. Sometimes the cyst is resolved via surgical marsupialization. A 2018 literature review of 740 records of surgeries that included recurrence rates found that primary midline closure surgeries resulted in a 67.9% recurrence rate within 20 years, and recommended that they should be discontinued due to the high recurrence rate. Incision and drainage had a recurrence rate of 25.9% within 2 years, up to 40.2% in 5 years. Phenol treatment has a recurrence rate of 14.1% at 2 years and 40.4% at 5 years. A 2024 study involving 667 people found that, compared with tissue-removing surgery, minor procedures (such as draining and pit-picking) were associated with less pain, fewer complications and a faster recovery. However, minor surgeries were less likely to resolve the condition. Surgeons can also excise the sinus and repair it with a reconstructive flap technique, such as a ""cleft lift"" procedure or Z-plasty, usually done under general anesthetic. This approach is especially useful for complicated or recurring pilonidal disease, leaves little scar tissue, and flattens the region between the buttocks, reducing the risk of recurrence. This approach typically results in a more rapid recovery than traditional surgery; however, there are fewer surgeons trained in the cleft lift procedure, and it consequently may not be as accessible to patients, depending on their location. Meta-analysis shows recurrence rates were lower in open healing than with primary closure (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.87), at the expense of healing time. Pilonidal cysts can recur, and do so more frequently if the surgical wound is sutured in the midline, as opposed to away from the midline, which obliterates the natal cleft and removes the focus of shearing stress. An incision lateral to the intergluteal cleft is therefore preferred, especially given the poor healing of midline incisions in this region. Minimally invasive techniques with no wound and rapid return to full activities have been reported but await double-blind randomized trials. Another technique is to treat the pilonidal sinus with fibrin glue. This technique is of unclear benefit as of 2017 due to insufficient research. The evidence for any treatment is of low quality, and care must be taken not to overinterpret any study in this field. Since the 2010s, several minimally invasive techniques have been developed to minimize the impact of surgery on patients and achieve less pain and shorter recovery times. In some cases, the wounds are left open after surgery to heal naturally instead of being closed with stitches. There are a lot of different dressings and topical agents (creams or lotions) that are available to help these open wounds heal. A 2022 systematic review brought together evidence from 11 studies that compared dressings and topical agents for treating open wounds after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus of the buttocks. The authors concluded that: platelet rich plasma may help wounds to heal quicker compared to sterile gauze; Lietofix skin repair cream may help wounds to heal by 30 days compared to iodine (which helps to reduce bacteria in the wound); but it is not clear whether hydrogel dressings (designed to keep the wound moist) reduce the time it takes wounds to heal compared with cleaning the wound with iodine. Endoscopic pilonidal treatment, which uses a small camera to guide the surgeon in removing hair, is a newer method of treatment that has minimal pain and quick healing compared to surgery. A literature review of 497 patients found that the average endoscopic operation time was 34.7 minutes, and the average healing time was 32.9 days.

Pleomorphic adenoma,"Painless lump or swelling, Facial changes","Pleomorphic adenoma (or benign mixed tumor) is a common benign salivary gland neoplasm characterised by neoplastic proliferation of epithelial (ductal) cells along with myoepithelial components, having a malignant potentiality. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor and the most common tumor of the parotid gland. It derives its name from the architectural Pleomorphism (variable appearance) seen by light microscopy.","Overall, the mainstay of the treatment for salivary gland tumor is surgical resection. Needle biopsy is highly recommended prior to surgery to confirm the diagnosis. More detailed surgical technique and the support for additional adjuvant radiotherapy depends on whether the tumor is malignant or benign. Surgical treatment of parotid gland tumors is sometimes difficult, partly because of the anatomical relationship of the facial nerve and the parotid lodge, but also through the increased potential for postoperative relapse. Thus, detection of early stages of a tumor of the parotid gland is extremely important in terms of prognosis after surgery. There have been several approaches for surgery of parotid pleomorphic adenoma in the course of time. Enucleation of the tumor (i.e. intracapsular dissection), a procedure that was common in the early 20th century, is nowadays obsolete due to very high incidence of recurrence. After the time of enucleations, pleomorphic adenomas of parotid gland were recommended to be routinely treated with superficial or total parotidectomy. These procedures combine complete tumor removal and identification of the main trunk of facial nerve during surgery to avoid any lesions to the nerve. However, extensive surgery may cause significant morbidity, such as Frey´s syndrome (excessive sweat while eating) and salivary fistula. Also, aesthetic outcome may be compromised. Therefore, less invasive procedures have been preferred in selected cases during the recent years, and introduction of perioperative neuromonitoring enabled the evolution of several different surgical techniques some twenty years ago. Currently, the choice of surgical approach for parotid pleomorphic adenoma is mainly based on the size, location, and mobility of the tumor. The recommended main techniques include extracapsular dissection, partial superficial parotidectomy, and lateral or total parotidectomy. Nevertheless, the experience of surgeon plays a key role in the results of these distinct procedures. An important point of view is that recurrent pleomorphic adenomas may occur after a very long time from primary surgery, on average over 7–10 years but up to 24 years afterwards. Thus, it is of utmost importance to evaluate the ultimate results of these different surgical techniques in the future. The benign tumors of the submandibular gland is treated by simple excision with preservation of mandibular branch of the facial nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, and the lingual nerve. Other benign tumors of minor salivary glands are treated similarly. Malignant salivary tumors usually require wide local resection of the primary tumor. However, if complete resection cannot be achieved, adjuvant radiotherapy should be added to improve local control. This surgical treatment has many sequelae such as cranial nerve damage, Frey's syndrome, cosmetic problems, etc. Usually about 44% of the patients have a complete histologic removal of the tumor and this refers to the most significant survival rate.","['painless lump or swelling', 'facial changes']","pleomorphic adenoma painless lump or swelling, facial changes pleomorphic adenoma (or benign mixed tumor) is a common benign salivary gland neoplasm characterised by neoplastic proliferation of epithelial (ductal) cells along with myoepithelial components, having a malignant potentiality. it is the most common type of salivary gland tumor and the most common tumor of the parotid gland. it derives its name from the architectural pleomorphism (variable appearance) seen by light microscopy. overall, the mainstay of the treatment for salivary gland tumor is surgical resection. needle biopsy is highly recommended prior to surgery to confirm the diagnosis. more detailed surgical technique and the support for additional adjuvant radiotherapy depends on whether the tumor is malignant or benign. surgical treatment of parotid gland tumors is sometimes difficult, partly because of the anatomical relationship of the facial nerve and the parotid lodge, but also through the increased potential for postoperative relapse. thus, detection of early stages of a tumor of the parotid gland is extremely important in terms of prognosis after surgery. there have been several approaches for surgery of parotid pleomorphic adenoma in the course of time. enucleation of the tumor (i.e. intracapsular dissection), a procedure that was common in the early 20th century, is nowadays obsolete due to very high incidence of recurrence. after the time of enucleations, pleomorphic adenomas of parotid gland were recommended to be routinely treated with superficial or total parotidectomy. these procedures combine complete tumor removal and identification of the main trunk of facial nerve during surgery to avoid any lesions to the nerve. however, extensive surgery may cause significant morbidity, such as frey s syndrome (excessive sweat while eating) and salivary fistula. also, aesthetic outcome may be compromised. therefore, less invasive procedures have been preferred in selected cases during the recent years, and introduction of perioperative neuromonitoring enabled the evolution of several different surgical techniques some twenty years ago. currently, the choice of surgical approach for parotid pleomorphic adenoma is mainly based on the size, location, and mobility of the tumor. the recommended main techniques include extracapsular dissection, partial superficial parotidectomy, and lateral or total parotidectomy. nevertheless, the experience of surgeon plays a key role in the results of these distinct procedures. an important point of view is that recurrent pleomorphic adenomas may occur after a very long time from primary surgery, on average over 7 10 years but up to 24 years afterwards. thus, it is of utmost importance to evaluate the ultimate results of these different surgical techniques in the future. the benign tumors of the submandibular gland is treated by simple excision with preservation of mandibular branch of the facial nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, and the lingual nerve. other benign tumors of minor salivary glands are treated similarly. malignant salivary tumors usually require wide local resection of the primary tumor. however, if complete resection cannot be achieved, adjuvant radiotherapy should be added to improve local control. this surgical treatment has many sequelae such as cranial nerve damage, frey s syndrome, cosmetic problems, etc. usually about 44 of the patients have a complete histologic removal of the tumor and this refers to the most significant survival rate."

Pneumonia,"Cough, fever, chest pain, difficulty breathing","Demam, batuk berdahak, sesak napas. Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it. The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.","Prevention includes vaccination, environmental measures, and appropriate treatment of other health problems. It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000. Antibiotics by mouth, rest, simple analgesics, and fluids usually suffice for complete resolution. Antibiotics therapy for children aged 2 to 59 months with non‐severe pneumonia with wheeze may reduce of treatment failure by 20%, however results in little or no difference to clinical cure, in little or no difference to relapse, and treatment harms. However, those with other medical conditions, the elderly, or those with significant trouble breathing may require more advanced care. If the symptoms worsen, the pneumonia does not improve with home treatment, or complications occur, hospitalization may be required. Worldwide, approximately 7–13% of cases in children result in hospitalization, whereas in the developed world between 22 and 42% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia are admitted. The CURB-65 score is useful for determining the need for admission in adults. If the score is 0 or 1, people can typically be managed at home; if it is 2, a short hospital stay or close follow-up is needed; if it is 3–5, hospitalization is recommended. In children those with respiratory distress or oxygen saturations of less than 90% should be hospitalized. The utility of chest physiotherapy in pneumonia has not yet been determined. Over-the-counter cough medicine has not been found to be effective, nor has the use of zinc supplementation in children. There is insufficient evidence for mucolytics. There is no strong evidence to recommend that children who have non-measles related pneumonia take vitamin A supplements. Vitamin D, as of 2023, is of unclear benefit in children. Vitamin C administration in pneumonia needs further research, despite found lower mortality and reduced severity for most ill patient, although it can be given to patient of low plasma vitamin C because it is not expensive and low risk. Pneumonia can cause severe illness in a number of ways, and pneumonia with evidence of organ dysfunction may require intensive care unit admission for observation and specific treatment. The main impact is on the respiratory and the circulatory system. Respiratory failure not responding to normal oxygen therapy may require heated humidified high-flow therapy delivered through nasal cannulae, non-invasive ventilation, or in severe cases mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube. Regarding circulatory problems as part of sepsis, evidence of poor blood flow or low blood pressure is initially treated with 30 mL/kg of crystalloid infused intravenously. In situations where fluids alone are ineffective, vasopressor medication may be required. For adults with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) undergoing mechanical ventilation, there is a reduction in mortality when people lie on their front for at least 12 hours a day.

Pneumothorax,,"A pneumothorax is collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, in which case the air pressure in the space between chest wall and lungs can be higher; this has been historically referred to as a tension pneumothorax, although its existence among spontaneous episodes is a matter of debate.","The treatment of pneumothorax depends on a number of factors and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a chest tube. Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms and indicators of acute illness, the presence of underlying lung disease, the estimated size of the pneumothorax on X-ray, and – in some instances – on the personal preference of the person involved. In traumatic pneumothorax, chest tubes are usually inserted. If mechanical ventilation is required, the risk of tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory. Any open chest wound should be covered with an airtight seal, as it carries a high risk of leading to tension pneumothorax. Ideally, a dressing called the ""Asherman seal"" should be utilized, as it appears to be more effective than a standard ""three-sided"" dressing. The Asherman seal is a specially designed device that adheres to the chest wall and, through a valve-like mechanism, allows air to escape but not to enter the chest. Tension pneumothorax is usually treated with urgent needle decompression. This may be required before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. Critical care teams are able to incise the chest to create a larger conduit as performed when placing a chest drain, but without inserting the chest tube. This is called a simple thoracostomy. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression or simple thoracostomy is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output. A preventative procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended after an episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation of the risk of recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides (""bilateral""), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.",[],"pneumothorax a pneumothorax is collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. in a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, in which case the air pressure in the space between chest wall and lungs can be higher this has been historically referred to as a tension pneumothorax, although its existence among spontaneous episodes is a matter of debate. the treatment of pneumothorax depends on a number of factors and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a chest tube. treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms and indicators of acute illness, the presence of underlying lung disease, the estimated size of the pneumothorax on x-ray, and in some instances on the personal preference of the person involved. in traumatic pneumothorax, chest tubes are usually inserted. if mechanical ventilation is required, the risk of tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory. any open chest wound should be covered with an airtight seal, as it carries a high risk of leading to tension pneumothorax. ideally, a dressing called the asherman seal should be utilized, as it appears to be more effective than a standard three-sided dressing. the asherman seal is a specially designed device that adheres to the chest wall and, through a valve-like mechanism, allows air to escape but not to enter the chest. tension pneumothorax is usually treated with urgent needle decompression. this may be required before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. the needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. critical care teams are able to incise the chest to create a larger conduit as performed when placing a chest drain, but without inserting the chest tube. this is called a simple thoracostomy. if tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression or simple thoracostomy is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output. a preventative procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended after an episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in europe and the us. not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions the decision depends largely on estimation of the risk of recurrence. these procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ( bilateral ), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy."

Polycystic Kidney Disease,"Abdominal pain, high blood pressure, kidney cysts","Polycystic kidney disease (PKD or PCKD, also known as polycystic kidney syndrome) is a genetic disorder in which the renal tubules become structurally abnormal, resulting in the development and growth of multiple cysts within the kidney. These cysts may begin to develop in utero, in infancy, childhood, or in adulthood. Cysts are non-functioning tubules filled with fluid pumped into them, which range in size from microscopic to enormous, crushing adjacent normal tubules and eventually rendering them non-functional as well.","In 2018, Jynarque (tolvaptan) was introduced as the first FDA-approved treatment for PKD. In a recent long-term study, patients using tolvaptan had a 6.4% higher kidney function after 5 years compared to standard of care. In 2019, a team of researchers at UCSB found that a ketogenic diet might be able to halt, or even reverse progression in mice, and the results of a first human case series study are showing potential benefit. The results of a 3-month randomized, prospective dietary intervention clinical trial are pending. In addition, recent research indicates that mild to moderate calorie restriction or time-restricted feeding slow the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in mice. Patient communities have been combining both ketogenic diets and time-restricted feeding with a low-oxalate diet to prevent the formation of stones and early reports show an average of 17% increase in kidney function after approximately one year on a ketogenic, time-restricted dietary regimen.

Pompe Disease,"Progressive muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, fatigue","Kelemahan otot progresif, kesulitan bernapas, kelelahan. Genetic disorder of alpha-glucosidase enzyme deficiency.","Cardiac and respiratory complications are treated symptomatically. Physical and occupational therapy may be beneficial for some patients. Alterations in diet may provide temporary improvement but will not alter the course of the disease. Genetic counseling can provide families with information regarding risk in future pregnancies. On April 28, 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a biologic license application (BLA) for alglucosidase alfa, rhGAA (Myozyme), the first treatment for patients with Pompe disease, developed by a team of Duke University researchers. This was based on enzyme replacement therapy using biologically active recombinant human alglucosidase alfa produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Myozyme falls under the FDA orphan drug designation and was approved under a priority review. The FDA approved Myozyme for administration by intravenous infusion of the solution. The safety and efficacy of Myozyme were assessed in two separate clinical trials in 39 infantile-onset patients with Pompe disease ranging in age from 1 month to 3.5 years at the time of the first infusion. Myozyme treatment prolongs ventilator-free survival and overall survival. Early diagnosis and early treatment lead to much better outcomes. The treatment is not without side effects which include fever, flushing, skin rash, increased heart rate, and even shock; these conditions, however, are usually manageable. Myozyme costs an average of US$300,000 a year and must be taken for the patient's entire life, so some American health insurers have refused to pay for it. In August 2006, Health Canada approved Myozyme for the treatment of Pompe disease. In June 2007, the Canadian Common Drug Review issued its recommendations regarding public funding for Myozyme therapy. Their recommendation was to provide funding to treat a tiny subset of Pompe patients (Infants less one year of age with cardiomyopathy). In May 2010, the FDA approved Lumizyme for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease. Lumizyme and Myozyme have the same generic ingredient (alglucosidase alfa) and manufacturer (Genzyme Corporation). The difference between these two products is in the manufacturing process. Myozyme is made using a 160-L bioreactor, while Lumizyme uses a 4000-L bioreactor. Because of the difference in the manufacturing process, the FDA claims that the two products are biologically different. Myozyme is FDA approved for replacement therapy for infantile-onset Pompe disease. In July 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the authorization of avalglucosidase alfa. Avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2021, and in the European Union in June 2022. In December 2022, the EMA recommended the authorization of cipaglucosidase alfa. The approval was given in June 2023. In the EU, the therapy is available to all age groups without restrictions on weight of patients.

Symptoms include extreme sadness, low energy, anxiety, crying episodes, irritability, and extreme changes in sleeping or eating patterns. PPD can also negatively affect the newborn child.","A 2013 Cochrane review found evidence that psychosocial or psychological intervention after childbirth helped reduce the risk of postnatal depression. These interventions included home visits, telephone-based peer support, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Support is an important aspect of prevention, as depressed mothers commonly state that their feelings of depression were brought on by ""lack of support"" and ""feeling isolated."" Across different cultures, traditional rituals for postpartum care may be preventative for PPD but are more effective when the support is welcomed by the mother. In couples, emotional closeness and global support by the partner protect against both perinatal depression and anxiety. In 2014, Alasoom and Koura found that compared to 42.9 percent of women who did not get spousal support, only 14.7 percent of women who got spousal assistance had PPD. Further factors such as communication between the couple and relationship satisfaction have a protective effect against anxiety alone. In those who are at risk counseling is recommended. The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) conducted a review of evidence which supported the use of counseling interventions such as therapy for the prevention of PPD in high-risk groups. Women who are considered to be high-risk include those with a past or present history of depression, or with certain socioeconomic factors such as low income or young age. Preventative treatment with antidepressants may be considered for those who have had PPD previously. However, as of 2017, the evidence supporting such use is weak. Community perinatal mental health teams were launched in England in 2016 to improve access to mental healthcare for pregnant women. They aim to prevent and treat episodes of mental illness during pregnancy and after birth. Researchers found that in areas of the country where teams were available, women who had previous contact with psychiatric services (many of whom had a previous diagnosis of anxiety or depression) were more likely to access mental health support and had a lower risk of relapse requiring hospital admission in the year after giving birth.

Beginning in childhood, those affected become constantly hungry, which often leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes.","While PWS has no cure, several treatments are available to lessen the condition's symptoms. During infancy, subjects should undergo therapies to improve muscle strength. Speech and occupational therapy are also indicated. During the school years, children benefit from a highly structured learning environment and extra help. The largest problem associated with the syndrome is severe obesity. Access to food must be strictly supervised and limited, usually by installing locks on all food-storage places, including refrigerators. Physical activity in individuals with PWS for all ages is needed to optimize strength and promote a healthy lifestyle. An intranasal formulation of betahistine dihydrochloride received orphan drug designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity associated with Prader–Willi syndrome. In March 2025, the FDA approved a drug, to be called Vykat XR, that treats the acute hunger that is a symptom of PWS. Prescription of daily recombinant growth hormone injections is indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain. Because of severe obesity, obstructive sleep apnea is a common sequela, and a positive airway pressure machine is often needed. A person who has been diagnosed with PWS may have to undergo surgical procedures. One surgery that has proven to be unsuccessful for treating obesity is the gastric bypass procedure.

Primary Insomnia,"Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, daytime sleepiness, irritability, difficulty concentrating","Insomnia, also known as sleeplessness, is a sleep disorder causing difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep for as long as desired. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. It may result in an increased risk of accidents as well as problems focusing and learning.","Prevention and treatment of insomnia may require a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, medications, and lifestyle changes. Among lifestyle practices, going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day can create a steady pattern which may help to prevent insomnia. Avoidance of vigorous exercise and caffeinated drinks a few hours before going to sleep is recommended, while exercise earlier in the day may be beneficial. Other practices to improve sleep hygiene may include: Avoiding or limiting naps Treating pain at bedtime Avoiding large meals, beverages, alcohol, and nicotine before bedtime Finding soothing ways to relax into sleep, including the use of white noise Making the bedroom suitable for sleep by keeping it dark, cool, and free of devices, such as clocks, cell phones, or televisions Maintain regular exercise Try relaxing activities before sleeping It is recommended to rule out medical and psychological causes before deciding on the treatment for insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. The beneficial effects, in contrast to those produced by medications, may last well beyond the stopping of therapy. Medications have been used mainly to reduce symptoms in insomnia of short duration; their role in the management of chronic insomnia remains unclear. Several different types of medications may be used. Many doctors do not recommend relying on prescription sleeping pills for long-term use. These medications are not recommended for more than four or five weeks, although they can be used longer in certain instances.

Treatment of prostate cancer varies based on how advanced the cancer is, the risk it may spread, and the affected person's health and personal preferences. Those with localized disease at low risk for spread are often more likely to be harmed by the side effects of treatment than the disease itself, and so are regularly tested for a worsening of their disease. Those at higher risk may receive treatment to eliminate the tumor – typically prostatectomy (surgery to remove the prostate) or radiation therapy, sometimes alongside hormone therapy.

Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Shortness of breath, dry cough, fatigue","Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which the lungs become scarred over time. Symptoms include shortness of breath, a dry cough, feeling tired, weight loss, and nail clubbing. Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and lung cancer.","Pulmonary fibrosis creates scar tissue. The scarring is permanent once it has developed. Slowing the progression and prevention depends on the underlying cause: Treatment options for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are very limited, since no current treatment has stopped the progression of the disease. Because of this, there is no evidence that any medication can significantly help this condition, despite ongoing research trials. However, current treatment options such as pirfenidone and nintedanib can help slow progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the most common form of pulmonary fibrosis. Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option available in severe cases. A lung transplant can improve the patient's quality of life. Immunosuppressive drugs can also be considered. These are sometimes prescribed to slow the processes that lead to fibrosis. Some types of lung fibrosis respond to corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Oxygen therapy is also an option. The patient may choose how much oxygen to use. The use of oxygen doesn't repair the lung damage, but can: make breathing and exercise easier; prevent or lessen complication from low blood oxygen levels; reduce blood pressure; and improve sleep and sense of well-being. The immune system is thought to play a central role in the development of many forms of pulmonary fibrosis. The goal of treatment with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids is to decrease lung inflammation and subsequent scarring. Responses to treatment vary. Those whose conditions improve with immunosuppressive treatment probably do not have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has no significant treatment or cure. Two pharmacological agents intended to prevent scarring in mild idiopathic fibrosis are pirfenidone, which reduced reductions in the 1-year rate of decline in FVC and reduced the decline in distances on the 6-minute walk test, but had no effect on respiratory symptoms, and is nintedanib, which acts as an antifibrotic, mediated through the inhibition of a variety of tyrosine kinase receptors (including platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor). A randomized clinical trial showed it reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations. Preclinical studies on monoclonal antibodies that target the pulmonary endothelial aggregation receptor 1 (PEAR1) (which plays a crucial role in fibroblast activation and the progression of fibrosis) have shown promising results in slowing disease progression and improving lung function. Anti-inflammatory agents have only limited success in reducing the fibrotic process. Some other types of fibrosis, such as non-specific interstitial pneumonia, may respond to immunosuppressive therapy such as corticosteroids. But only a minority of patients respond to corticosteroids alone, so additional immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, penicillamine, and cyclosporine may be used. Colchicine has also been used with limited success. Trials with newer drugs such as IFN-γ and mycophenolate mofetil are ongoing.

Rabies,"Flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, fatigue), anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, difficulty swallowing","Nyeri bekas gigitan hewan, takut air, kejang otot. Rabies virus infection from wild animal bites.","Almost all human exposure to rabies was fatal until a vaccine was developed in 1885 by Louis Pasteur and Émile Roux. Their original vaccine was harvested from infected rabbits, from which the virus in the nerve tissue was weakened by allowing it to dry for five to ten days. Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used in some countries, as they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines. The human diploid cell rabies vaccine was started in 1967. Less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccine and purified vero cell rabies vaccine are now available. A recombinant vaccine called V-RG has been used in Belgium, France, Germany, and the United States to prevent outbreaks of rabies in undomesticated animals. Immunization before exposure has been used in both human and nonhuman populations, where, as in many jurisdictions, domesticated animals are required to be vaccinated. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Communicable Disease Surveillance 2007 Annual Report states the following can help reduce the risk of contracting rabies: Vaccinating dogs, cats, and ferrets against rabies Keeping pets under supervision Not handling wild animals or strays Contacting an animal control officer upon observing a wild animal or a stray, especially if the animal is acting strangely If bitten by an animal, washing the wound with soap and water for 10 to 15 minutes and contacting a healthcare provider to determine if post-exposure prophylaxis is required 28 September is World Rabies Day, which promotes the information, prevention, and elimination of the disease. In Asia and in parts of the Americas and Africa, dogs remain the principal host. Mandatory vaccination of animals is less effective in rural areas. Especially in developing countries, pets may not be privately kept and their destruction may be unacceptable. Oral vaccines can be safely distributed in baits, a practice that has successfully reduced rabies in rural areas of Canada, France, and the United States. In Montreal, Quebec, Canada, baits are successfully used on raccoons in the Mount-Royal Park area. Vaccination campaigns may be expensive, but cost-benefit analysis suggests baits may be a cost-effective method of control. In Ontario, a dramatic drop in rabies was recorded when an aerial bait-vaccination campaign was launched. The number of recorded human deaths from rabies in the United States has dropped from 100 or more annually in the early 20th century to one or two per year because of widespread vaccination of domestic dogs and cats and the development of human vaccines and immunoglobulin treatments. Most deaths now result from bat bites, which may go unnoticed by the victim and hence untreated.","['flu-like symptoms (fever', 'headache', 'fatigue)', 'anxiety', 'confusion', 'hallucinations', 'difficulty swallowing']","rabies flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, fatigue), anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, difficulty swallowing nyeri bekas gigitan hewan, takut air, kejang otot. rabies virus infection from wild animal bites. almost all human exposure to rabies was fatal until a vaccine was developed in 1885 by louis pasteur and mile roux. their original vaccine was harvested from infected rabbits, from which the virus in the nerve tissue was weakened by allowing it to dry for five to ten days. similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used in some countries, as they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines. the human diploid cell rabies vaccine was started in 1967. less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccine and purified vero cell rabies vaccine are now available. a recombinant vaccine called v-rg has been used in belgium, france, germany, and the united states to prevent outbreaks of rabies in undomesticated animals. immunization before exposure has been used in both human and nonhuman populations, where, as in many jurisdictions, domesticated animals are required to be vaccinated. the missouri department of health and senior services communicable disease surveillance 2007 annual report states the following can help reduce the risk of contracting rabies vaccinating dogs, cats, and ferrets against rabies keeping pets under supervision not handling wild animals or strays contacting an animal control officer upon observing a wild animal or a stray, especially if the animal is acting strangely if bitten by an animal, washing the wound with soap and water for 10 to 15 minutes and contacting a healthcare provider to determine if post-exposure prophylaxis is required 28 september is world rabies day, which promotes the information, prevention, and elimination of the disease. in asia and in parts of the americas and africa, dogs remain the principal host. mandatory vaccination of animals is less effective in rural areas. especially in developing countries, pets may not be privately kept and their destruction may be unacceptable. oral vaccines can be safely distributed in baits, a practice that has successfully reduced rabies in rural areas of canada, france, and the united states. in montreal, quebec, canada, baits are successfully used on raccoons in the mount-royal park area. vaccination campaigns may be expensive, but cost-benefit analysis suggests baits may be a cost-effective method of control. in ontario, a dramatic drop in rabies was recorded when an aerial bait-vaccination campaign was launched. the number of recorded human deaths from rabies in the united states has dropped from 100 or more annually in the early 20th century to one or two per year because of widespread vaccination of domestic dogs and cats and the development of human vaccines and immunoglobulin treatments. most deaths now result from bat bites, which may go unnoticed by the victim and hence untreated."

Rotavirus,"Diarrhea, vomiting, fever, dehydration","Diare, muntah, demam, dehidrasi. Rotavirus infection, especially in children.","Treatment of acute rotavirus infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and, most importantly, management of dehydration. If untreated, children can die from the resulting severe dehydration. Depending on the severity of diarrhoea, treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy, during which the child is given extra water to drink that contains specific amounts of salt and sugar. In 2004, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF recommended the use of low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation as a two-pronged treatment of acute diarrhoea. Some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalisation where fluids are given by intravenous therapy or nasogastric intubation, and the child's electrolytes and blood sugar are monitored. Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child the prognosis is excellent. Probiotics have been shown to reduce the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea, and according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology ""effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii, diosmectite or racecadotril."" Rotaviruses are highly contagious and cannot be treated with antibiotics or other drugs. Because improved sanitation does not decrease the prevalence of rotaviral disease, and the rate of hospitalisations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines, the primary public health intervention is vaccination. In 1998, a rotavirus vaccine was licensed for use in the United States. Clinical trials in the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80–100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine. In 2006, two new vaccines against rotavirus A infection were shown to be safe and effective in children, and in 2009, the WHO recommended that rotavirus vaccine be included in all national immunisation programmes. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49–92% and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17–55%. In Mexico, which in 2006 was among the first countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months. A 2022 study found that the number of rotavirus cases in infants in England under one year of age was reduced by 77–88%. In all age groups, the number of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections was reduced by 69–83%. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotaviruses have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine. Globally, vaccination has reduced hospital admissions and emergency department visits by a median of 67%. Rotavirus vaccines are licensed in over 100 countries, and more than 80 countries have introduced routine rotavirus vaccination, almost half with the support of the GAVI vaccine alliance. To make rotavirus vaccines available, accessible, and affordable in all countries—particularly low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, PATH (formerly Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and GAVI have partnered with research institutions and governments to generate and disseminate evidence, lower prices, and accelerate introduction.

It usually resolves completely after delivery although cases of postpartum RLP (that is, RLP that persisted for a few days after delivery) have been reported.","Once RLP has been diagnosed, there are many ways to reduce the pain without jeopardizing the pregnancy. Analgesics. Acetaminophen or paracetamol is safe to take during pregnancy, thus is the most commonly prescribed pain reliever for pregnant women with RLP. Heat application. Applying a hot compress to the area of pain may give some relief. Hot soaks and hot baths may also help. Modifications in movements and position. Triggering factors that can cause RLP are sudden movements, (e.g. sitting up and down, standing up, sneezing, coughing), physical exertion, and long periods in the same resting position. A change in daily activities can help find relief and prevent worsening of the condition. Avoid sudden movements that can cause spasms of the ligament. When about to sneeze or cough, brace yourself by bending and flexing the hips to minimize the pull on the ligaments. Rest. Resting is one of the best remedies against RLP. When lying down, changing position slowly and regularly is recommended. Physical exercises. Daily stretching exercise may be recommended by a gynecologist. An example of such an exercise is kneeling with hands and knees on the floor, then lowering your head to the floor, and keeping your bottom up in the air. The so-called pelvic (hip) tilt exercise also appears to help in reducing pain intensity and duration. Surgery.

Rubella,"Spreading red rash, mild fever, joint pain","Ruam merah menyebar, demam ringan, nyeri sendi. Rubella virus infection, risky for pregnant women.","Rubella infections are prevented by active immunization programs using live attenuated virus vaccines. Two live attenuated virus vaccines, RA 27/3 and Cendehill strains, were effective in the prevention of adult disease. However, their use in prepubertal females did not produce a significant fall in the overall incidence rate of CRS in the UK. Reductions were only achieved by immunisation of all children. The vaccine is now usually given as part of the MMR vaccine. The WHO recommends the first dose be given at 12 to 18 months of age with a second dose at 36 months. Pregnant women are usually tested for immunity to rubella early on. Women found to be susceptible are not vaccinated until after the baby is born because the vaccine contains live virus. The immunisation program has been quite successful. Cuba declared the disease eliminated in the 1990s, and in 2004 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that both the congenital and acquired forms of rubella had been eliminated from the United States. The World Health Organization declared Australia rubella free in October 2018. Screening for rubella susceptibility by history of vaccination or by serology is recommended in the United States for all women of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant women of childbearing age should be offered rubella vaccination. Due to concerns about possible teratogenicity, use of MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Instead, susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the postpartum period. In susceptible people passive immunization, in the form of polyclonal immunoglobulins, appears effective up to the fifth day post-exposure.

Rumination Disorder,Repeated regurgitation and re-chewing of food,"Rumination syndrome, or merycism, is a chronic motility disorder characterized by effortless regurgitation of most meals following consumption, due to the involuntary contraction of the muscles around the abdomen. There is no retching, nausea, heartburn, odour, or abdominal pain associated with the regurgitation as there is with typical vomiting, and the regurgitated food is undigested. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence is as high as 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities).","There is presently no known cure for rumination. Proton pump inhibitors and other medications have been used to little or no effect. Treatment is different for infants and mentally disabled adults than for adults and adolescents of typical intelligence. Among infants and mentally disabled adults, behavioral and mild aversion training has been shown to cause improvement in most cases. Aversion training involves associating the ruminating behavior with negative results, and rewarding good behavior and eating. Placing a sour or bitter taste on the tongue when the individual begins the movements or breathing patterns typical of his or her ruminating behavior is the generally accepted method for aversion training, although some older studies advocate the use of pinching. In patients of normal intelligence, rumination is not an intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern can be used to prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents. Supportive therapy and diaphragmatic breathing has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% in one study of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments. Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better. Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting in the past have a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior. The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful.

Scarlet Fever,"Sore throat, fever, rash (red, sandpaper-like), swollen glands","Scarlet fever, also known as scarlatina and scarlatiniform rash, is an infectious disease caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, a Group A streptococcus (GAS). It most commonly affects children and young adolescents between five and 15 years of age. The signs and symptoms include a sore throat, fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and a characteristic rash.","One method is long-term use of antibiotics to prevent future group A streptococcal infections. This method is only indicated for people who have had complications like recurrent attacks of acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. Antibiotics are limited in their ability to prevent these infections since there are a variety of subtypes of group A streptococci that can cause the infection. Although there are currently no vaccines available, the vaccine approach has a greater likelihood of effectively preventing group A streptococcal infections in the future because vaccine formulations can target multiple subtypes of the bacteria. A vaccine developed by George and Gladys Dick in 1924 was discontinued due to poor efficacy and the introduction of antibiotics. Difficulties in vaccine development include the considerable strain variety of group A streptococci present in the environment and the amount of time and number of people needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of any potential vaccine. There have been several attempts to create a vaccine in the past few decades. These vaccines, which are still in the development phase, expose the person to proteins present on the surface of the group A streptococci to activate an immune response that will prepare the person to fight and prevent future infections. There used to be a diphtheria scarlet fever vaccine. It was, however, found not to be effective. This product was discontinued by the end of World War II. Antibiotics to combat the streptococcal infection are the mainstay of treatment for scarlet fever. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases the length of illness. Peeling of the outer layer of skin, however, will happen despite treatment. One of the main goals of treatment is to prevent the child from developing one of the suppurative or nonsuppurative complications, especially acute rheumatic fever. As long as antibiotics are started within nine days, it is very unlikely for the child to develop acute rheumatic fever. Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to prevent the development of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Another important reason for prompt treatment with antibiotics is the ability to prevent transmission of the infection between children. An infected individual is most likely to pass on the infection to another person during the first two weeks. A child is no longer contagious (able to pass the infection to another child) after 24 hours of antibiotics. The antibiotic of choice is Penicillin V which is taken by mouth. In countries without a liquid Penicillin V product, children unable to take tablets can be given amoxicillin which comes in a liquid form and is equally effective. Duration of treatment is 10 days. Benzathine penicillin G can be given as a one time intramuscular injection as another alternative if swallowing pills is not possible. If the person is allergic to the family of antibiotics which both penicillin and amoxicillin are a part of (beta-lactam antibiotics), a first generation cephalosporin is used. Cephalosporin antibiotics, however, can still cause adverse reactions in people whose allergic reaction to penicillin is a Type 1 Hypersensitivity reaction. In those cases it is appropriate to choose clindamycin or erythromycin instead. Tonsillectomy, although once a reasonable treatment for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, is not indicated, as a person can still be infected with group A streptococcus without their tonsils.","['sore throat', 'fever', 'rash (red', 'sandpaper-like)', 'swollen glands']","scarlet fever sore throat, fever, rash (red, sandpaper-like), swollen glands scarlet fever, also known as scarlatina and scarlatiniform rash, is an infectious disease caused by streptococcus pyogenes, a group a streptococcus (gas). it most commonly affects children and young adolescents between five and 15 years of age. the signs and symptoms include a sore throat, fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and a characteristic rash. one method is long-term use of antibiotics to prevent future group a streptococcal infections. this method is only indicated for people who have had complications like recurrent attacks of acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. antibiotics are limited in their ability to prevent these infections since there are a variety of subtypes of group a streptococci that can cause the infection. although there are currently no vaccines available, the vaccine approach has a greater likelihood of effectively preventing group a streptococcal infections in the future because vaccine formulations can target multiple subtypes of the bacteria. a vaccine developed by george and gladys dick in 1924 was discontinued due to poor efficacy and the introduction of antibiotics. difficulties in vaccine development include the considerable strain variety of group a streptococci present in the environment and the amount of time and number of people needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of any potential vaccine. there have been several attempts to create a vaccine in the past few decades. these vaccines, which are still in the development phase, expose the person to proteins present on the surface of the group a streptococci to activate an immune response that will prepare the person to fight and prevent future infections. there used to be a diphtheria scarlet fever vaccine. it was, however, found not to be effective. this product was discontinued by the end of world war ii. antibiotics to combat the streptococcal infection are the mainstay of treatment for scarlet fever. prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases the length of illness. peeling of the outer layer of skin, however, will happen despite treatment. one of the main goals of treatment is to prevent the child from developing one of the suppurative or nonsuppurative complications, especially acute rheumatic fever. as long as antibiotics are started within nine days, it is very unlikely for the child to develop acute rheumatic fever. antibiotic therapy has not been shown to prevent the development of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. another important reason for prompt treatment with antibiotics is the ability to prevent transmission of the infection between children. an infected individual is most likely to pass on the infection to another person during the first two weeks. a child is no longer contagious (able to pass the infection to another child) after 24 hours of antibiotics. the antibiotic of choice is penicillin v which is taken by mouth. in countries without a liquid penicillin v product, children unable to take tablets can be given amoxicillin which comes in a liquid form and is equally effective. duration of treatment is 10 days. benzathine penicillin g can be given as a one time intramuscular injection as another alternative if swallowing pills is not possible. if the person is allergic to the family of antibiotics which both penicillin and amoxicillin are a part of (beta-lactam antibiotics), a first generation cephalosporin is used. cephalosporin antibiotics, however, can still cause adverse reactions in people whose allergic reaction to penicillin is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. in those cases it is appropriate to choose clindamycin or erythromycin instead. tonsillectomy, although once a reasonable treatment for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, is not indicated, as a person can still be infected with group a streptococcus without their tonsils."

Schistosomiasis,"Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, swelling of the liver/spleen","Diare berdarah, nyeri perut, pembengkakan hati/spleen. Schistosoma worm infection from contact with contaminated fresh water.","Many countries are working towards eradicating the disease. The World Health Organization is promoting these efforts. In some cases, urbanization, pollution, and the consequent destruction of snail habitat have reduced exposure, with a subsequent decrease in new infections. The elimination of snail populations using molluscicides had been attempted to prevent schistosomiasis in the past, but it was an expensive process that often only reduced but did not eliminate the snail population. The drug praziquantel is used for prevention in high-risk populations living in areas where the disease is common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises avoiding drinking or coming into contact with contaminated water in areas where schistosomiasis is common. A 2014 review found tentative evidence that increasing access to clean water and sanitation reduces schistosome infection. Other important preventive measures include hygiene education leading to behavioral change and sanitary engineering to ensure a safe water supply. Two drugs, praziquantel and oxamniquine, are available for the treatment of schistosomiasis. They are considered equivalent in relation to efficacy against S. mansoni and safety. Historically, antimony potassium tartrate remained the treatment of choice for schistosomiasis until the development of praziquantel in the 1980s. Because of praziquantel's lower cost per treatment, and oxaminiquine's lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by S. haematobium, in general praziquantel is considered the first option for treatment. Praziquantel can be safely used in pregnant women and young children. The treatment objective is to cure the disease and prevent the progression of the acute to chronic form of the disease. All cases of suspected schistosomiasis should be treated regardless of presentation because the adult parasite can live in the host for years. Schistosomiasis is treatable by taking a single dose of the drug praziquantel by mouth annually. Praziquantel eliminates the adult schistosomes but does not kill the eggs and immature worms. Live eggs can be excreted by the infected individuals for weeks after treatment with praziquantel. The immature worms can survive and grow into adult schistosomes after praziquantel therapy. Thus, it is important to have repeated schistosomiasis testing of the stool and/or urine around 4–6 weeks after praziquantel therapy. Praziquantel treatment may be repeated to ensure complete parasite elimination. The WHO has developed guidelines for community treatment based on the impact the disease has on children in villages in which it is common: When a village reports more than 50 percent of children have blood in their urine, everyone in the village receives treatment. When 20 to 50 percent of children have bloody urine, only school-age children are treated. When fewer than 20 percent of children have symptoms, mass treatment is not implemented. Other possible treatments include a combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, artesunate, or mefloquine. A Cochrane review found tentative evidence that when used alone, metrifonate was as effective as praziquantel. Mefloquine, which has previously been used to treat and prevent malaria, was recognised in 2008–2009 to be effective against schistosomes. Post-treatment monitoring Osteopontin (OPN) is a promising tool for monitoring praziquantel efficacy and post-treatment fibrosis regression as (OPN) expression is modulated by S. mansoni egg antigens and its levels correlate with the severity of schistosomiasis fibrosis and portal hypertension in mice and humans. Praziquantel pharmacotherapy reduces systemic OPN levels and liver collagen content in mice.","['bloody diarrhea', 'abdominal pain', 'swelling of the liver/spleen']","schistosomiasis bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, swelling of the liver/spleen diare berdarah, nyeri perut, pembengkakan hati/spleen. schistosoma worm infection from contact with contaminated fresh water. many countries are working towards eradicating the disease. the world health organization is promoting these efforts. in some cases, urbanization, pollution, and the consequent destruction of snail habitat have reduced exposure, with a subsequent decrease in new infections. the elimination of snail populations using molluscicides had been attempted to prevent schistosomiasis in the past, but it was an expensive process that often only reduced but did not eliminate the snail population. the drug praziquantel is used for prevention in high-risk populations living in areas where the disease is common. the centers for disease control and prevention advises avoiding drinking or coming into contact with contaminated water in areas where schistosomiasis is common. a 2014 review found tentative evidence that increasing access to clean water and sanitation reduces schistosome infection. other important preventive measures include hygiene education leading to behavioral change and sanitary engineering to ensure a safe water supply. two drugs, praziquantel and oxamniquine, are available for the treatment of schistosomiasis. they are considered equivalent in relation to efficacy against s. mansoni and safety. historically, antimony potassium tartrate remained the treatment of choice for schistosomiasis until the development of praziquantel in the 1980s. because of praziquantel s lower cost per treatment, and oxaminiquine s lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by s. haematobium, in general praziquantel is considered the first option for treatment. praziquantel can be safely used in pregnant women and young children. the treatment objective is to cure the disease and prevent the progression of the acute to chronic form of the disease. all cases of suspected schistosomiasis should be treated regardless of presentation because the adult parasite can live in the host for years. schistosomiasis is treatable by taking a single dose of the drug praziquantel by mouth annually. praziquantel eliminates the adult schistosomes but does not kill the eggs and immature worms. live eggs can be excreted by the infected individuals for weeks after treatment with praziquantel. the immature worms can survive and grow into adult schistosomes after praziquantel therapy. thus, it is important to have repeated schistosomiasis testing of the stool and/or urine around 4 6 weeks after praziquantel therapy. praziquantel treatment may be repeated to ensure complete parasite elimination. the who has developed guidelines for community treatment based on the impact the disease has on children in villages in which it is common when a village reports more than 50 percent of children have blood in their urine, everyone in the village receives treatment. when 20 to 50 percent of children have bloody urine, only school-age children are treated. when fewer than 20 percent of children have symptoms, mass treatment is not implemented. other possible treatments include a combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, artesunate, or mefloquine. a cochrane review found tentative evidence that when used alone, metrifonate was as effective as praziquantel. mefloquine, which has previously been used to treat and prevent malaria, was recognised in 2008 2009 to be effective against schistosomes. post-treatment monitoring osteopontin (opn) is a promising tool for monitoring praziquantel efficacy and post-treatment fibrosis regression as (opn) expression is modulated by s. mansoni egg antigens and its levels correlate with the severity of schistosomiasis fibrosis and portal hypertension in mice and humans. praziquantel pharmacotherapy reduces systemic opn levels and liver collagen content in mice."
Schizophrenia,,"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized variously by hallucinations (typically, hearing voices), delusions, disorganized thinking or behavior, and flat or inappropriate affect. Symptoms develop gradually and typically begin during young adulthood and rarely resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a psychiatric history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.","Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder. Early intervention programs diagnose and treat patients in the prodromal phase of the illness. There is some evidence that these programs reduce symptoms. Patients tend to prefer early treatment programs to ordinary treatment and are less likely to disengage from them. As of 2020, it is unclear whether the benefits of early treatment persist once the treatment is terminated. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another preventive measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines. Antipsychotics are prescribed following a first-episode psychosis, and following remission, a preventive maintenance use is continued to avoid relapse. However, it is recognized that some people do recover following a single episode and that long-term use of antipsychotics will not be needed but there is no way of identifying this group. The primary treatment of schizophrenia is the use of antipsychotic medications, often in combination with psychosocial interventions and social supports. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment, and support groups are common. The time between the onset of psychotic symptoms to being given treatment – the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) – is associated with a poorer outcome in both the short term and the long term. Voluntary or involuntary admission to hospital may be imposed by doctors and courts who deem a person to be having a severe episode. In the UK, large mental hospitals termed asylums began to be closed down in the 1950s with the advent of antipsychotics, and with an awareness of the negative impact of long-term hospital stays on recovery. This process was known as deinstitutionalization, and community and supportive services were developed to support this change. Many other countries followed suit with the US starting in the 60s. There still remain a smaller group of people who do not improve enough to be discharged.

Scoliosis,,"Scoliosis (pl.: scolioses) is a medical condition in which the spine has an irregular curve in the coronal plane. The curve is usually S- or C-shaped over three dimensions. In some, the degree of curve is stable, while in others, it increases over time.","Our lack of understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of scoliosis makes it difficult to manage. Scoliosis curves do not straighten out on their own. Many children have slight curves that do not need treatment. In these cases, the children grow up to lead a normal body posture by itself, even though their small curves never go away. If the patient is still growing and has a larger curve, it is important to monitor the curve for change by periodic examination and standing x-rays as needed. The rise in spinal abnormalities requires examination by a neurosurgeon to determine if active treatment is needed. Although AIS normally does not cause health problems throughout development, the observable changes in appearance can have a substantial impact on teenagers, leading to quality-of-life concerns and, in extreme cases, emotional stress. The traditional medical management of scoliosis is complex and is determined by the severity of the curvature and skeletal maturity, which together help predict the likelihood of progression. The conventional options for children and adolescents are: Observation Bracing Surgery Physical therapy. Evidence suggests use of scoliosis specific exercises might prevent the progression of the curve along with possible bracing and surgery avoidance. For adults, treatment usually focuses on relieving any pain: Pain medication Posture checking Bracing Surgery Treatment for idiopathic scoliosis also depends upon the severity of the curvature, the spine's potential for further growth, and the risk that the curvature will progress. Mild scoliosis (less than 30° deviation) and moderate scoliosis (30–45°) can typically be treated conservatively with bracing in conjunction with scoliosis-specific exercises. Severe curvatures that rapidly progress may require surgery with spinal rod placement and spinal fusion. In all cases, early intervention offers the best results. A specific type of physical therapy may be useful. Evidence to support its use, however, is weak. Low quality evidence suggests scoliosis-specific exercises (SSE) may be more effective than electrostimulation. Evidence for the Schroth method is insufficient to support its use. Significant improvement in function, vertebral angles and trunk asymmetries have been recorded following the implementation of Schroth method in terms of conservative management of scoliosis.

Scurvy,"Fatigue, swollen and bleeding gums, joint pain","In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight. Intuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: ""The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width."" This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function.","Scurvy can be prevented by a diet that includes uncooked vitamin C-rich foods such as amla, bell peppers (sweet peppers), blackcurrants, broccoli, chili peppers, citrus fruits (lemon, lime, orange, etc), kiwifruit, and parsley. Other sources rich in vitamin C are dandelion, raw liver (23.6 mg/100 grams), sauerkraut, and many fruits such as guava, papaya, strawberries, and tomato. It is also found in vegetables, such as brussels sprouts, cabbage, potatoes, and spinach. Some fruits and vegetables not high in vitamin C may be pickled in lemon juice, which is high in vitamin C. Nutritional supplements that provide ascorbic acid well above what is required to prevent scurvy may cause adverse health effects. Uncooked fresh meat from animals, notably internal organs, contains enough vitamin C to prevent scurvy, and even partly treat it. Scott's 1902 Antarctic expedition used fresh seal meat and increased allowance of bottled fruits, whereby complete recovery from incipient scurvy was reported to have taken less than two weeks. Scurvy will improve with doses of vitamin C as low as 10 mg per day though doses of around 100 mg per day are typically recommended.

Meningocele and myelomeningocele may be grouped as spina bifida cystica.","There is neither a single cause of spina bifida nor any known way to prevent it entirely. However, dietary supplementation with folic acid has been shown to be helpful in reducing the incidence of spina bifida. Folate supplementation prior to conception has been found to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, including spina bifida, by 70%. Sources of folic acid include whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals, dried beans, leaf vegetables and fruits. However it is difficult for women to get the recommended 400 micrograms of folic acid a day from unfortified foods. Globally, fortified wheat flour and other cereal grains are credited with preventing 50,000–61,000 neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida yearly, which is estimated to be 22% of total possible preventable neural tube defects assuming universal and worldwide folic acid fortification. Many countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe have yet to implement fortification Folate fortification of enriched grain products has been mandatory in the United States since 1998. This prevents an estimated 600 to 700 incidents of spina bifida a year in the U.S. and saves $400–600 million in healthcare expenses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Public Health Agency of Canada and the UK Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) recommended amount of folic acid for women of childbearing age and women planning to become pregnant is at least 0.4 mg/day of folic acid from at least three months before conception, and continued for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends all people who may become pregnant or are attempting pregnancy take a folic acid supplement containing 0.4–0.8 mg (400–800 mcg) of folic acid daily. Women who have already had a baby with spina bifida or other type of neural tube defect, or are taking anticonvulsant medication, should take a higher dose of 4–5 mg/day. However, the daily requirement of folate and the recommended folate blood levels to prevent neural tube defects are not well established. There is no known cure for the nerve damage caused by spina bifida. Standard treatment is surgery after delivery. This surgery aims to prevent further damage of the nervous tissue and to prevent infection; pediatric neurosurgeons operate to close the opening on the back. The spinal cord and its nerve roots are put back inside the spine and covered with meninges. In addition, a shunt may be surgically installed to provide a continuous drain for the excess cerebrospinal fluid produced in the brain, as happens with hydrocephalus.

Subdural hemorrhage,"Headache, confusion, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, seizures, weakness or numbness","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of blood—usually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injury—gathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space. Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue.","Treatment of a subdural hematoma depends on its size and rate of growth. Some small subdural hematomas can be managed by careful monitoring as the blood clot is eventually resorbed naturally. Others can be treated by inserting a small catheter through a hole drilled through the skull and sucking out the hematoma. Large or symptomatic hematomas require a craniotomy. A surgeon opens the skull and then the dura mater; removes the clot with suction or irrigation; and identifies and controls sites of bleeding. The injured vessels must be repaired. Postoperative complications can include increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, new or recurrent bleeding, infection, and seizures. In patients with a chronic subdural hematoma but no history of seizures, it is unclear whether anticonvulsants are harmful or beneficial.

If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the most common form of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother's eggs for in vitro fertilization, it is possible to test the embryo for the disorder before implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders. Pre-marriage screening. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that carriers for Tay–Sachs and other genetic disorders can avoid marrying each other. As of 2010, no treatment addressed the cause of Tay–Sachs disease or could slow its progression; people receive supportive care to ease the symptoms and extend life by reducing the chance of contracting infections. Infants are given feeding tubes when they can no longer swallow.

Corticosteroids, typically high-dose prednisone (1 mg/kg/day), should be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected (even before the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy) to prevent irreversible blindness secondary to ophthalmic artery occlusion. Steroids do not prevent the diagnosis from later being confirmed by biopsy, although certain changes in the histology may be observed towards the end of the first week of treatment and are more difficult to identify after a couple of months. The dose of corticosteroids is generally slowly tapered over 12–18 months.

Infeksi bakteri Clostridium tetani dari luka terbuka.","Unlike many infectious diseases, recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in immunity. This is due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin. Tetanospasmin will likely be lethal before it will provoke an immune response. Tetanus can be prevented by vaccination with tetanus toxoid. The CDC recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years, and standard care practice in many places is to give the booster to any person with a puncture wound who is uncertain of when they were last vaccinated, or if they have had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine. The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound, as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form. In children under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis. For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used. The World Health Organization certifies countries as having eliminated maternal or neonatal tetanus. Certification requires at least two years of rates of less than 1 case per 1,000 live births.

Thalassemia,"Chronic anemia, stunted growth","Chronic anemia, stunted growth. Genetic abnormalities in hemoglobin.","Treatment for thalassemia depends on the severity of the disease. People with thalassemia traits (thalassemia minor or non transfusion dependent thalassemia), may not require medical or follow-up care after the initial diagnosis is made. Occasionally transfusions may be necessary particularly around childbirth, surgery, or if other conditions provoke anemia. A folic acid supplement may also be recommended. For those with severe forms of thalassemia (thalassemia major, or transfusion-dependent thalassemia), the three principal treatments are red blood cell transfusions to relieve anemia, iron chelation to mitigate the side effects of transfusion, and folic acid supplementation to encourage the growth of new blood cells. Other forms of treatment available depending on individual circumstances. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends all people thinking of becoming pregnant be tested to see if they have thalassemia. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who carry a thalassemia trait. Understanding the genetic risk, ideally before a family is started, would hopefully allow families to understand more about the condition and make an informed decision that is best for their family. A screening policy exists in Cyprus to reduce the rate of thalassemia, which, since the program's implementation in the 1970s (also including prenatal screening and abortion), has reduced the number of children born with the disease from one of every 158 births to almost zero. Greece also has a screening program to identify people who are carriers. In Iran as a premarital screening, the man's red cell indices are checked first. If he has microcytosis (mean cell hemoglobin < 27 pg or mean red cell volume < 80 fl), the woman is tested. When both are microcytic, their hemoglobin A2 concentrations are measured. If both have a concentration above 3.5% (diagnostic of thalassemia trait) they are referred to the local designated health post for genetic counseling.

Tuberculosis,"cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats","Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.","The main strategies to prevent infection with TB are treatment of both active and latent TB, as well as vaccination of children who are at risk. Although latent TB is not infective, it should be treated in order to prevent its development into active pulmonary TB, which is infective. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (""overt"") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others; however it is important to complete the full course of treatment which is usually six months. Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective.","['cough', 'weight loss', 'fever', 'night sweats']","tuberculosis cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats tuberculosis (tb) is an infectious disease usually caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) bacteria. tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. the main strategies to prevent infection with tb are treatment of both active and latent tb, as well as vaccination of children who are at risk. although latent tb is not infective, it should be treated in order to prevent its development into active pulmonary tb, which is infective. the cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ( overt ) tb and putting them on anti-tb drug regimens. after about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others however it is important to complete the full course of treatment which is usually six months. treatment of tb uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria. effective tb treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective."

Assess children for behavioural issues, autism spectrum disorder, psychiatric disorders, developmental delay, and neuropsychological problems. Scan the abdomen for tumours in various organs, but most importantly angiomyolipomata in the kidneys. MRI is superior to CT or ultrasound. Take blood pressure and test renal function. In adult women, test pulmonary function and perform a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. Examine the skin under a Wood's lamp (hypomelanotic macules), the fingers and toes (ungual fibroma), the face (angiofibromas), and the mouth (dental pits and gingival fibromas). In infants under three, perform an echocardiogram to spot rhabdomyomas, and electrocardiogram (ECG) for any arrhythmia. Use a fundoscope to spot retinal hamartomas or achromic patches. The various symptoms and complications from TSC may appear throughout life, requiring continued surveillance and adjustment to treatments. The following ongoing tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference. In children and adults younger than 25 years, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is performed every one to three years to monitor for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). If a SEGA is large, growing or interfering with ventricles, the MRI is performed more frequently. After 25 years, if there are no SEGAs then periodic scans may no longer be required. A SEGA causing acute symptoms are removed with surgery, otherwise either surgery or drug treatment with an mTOR inhibitor may be indicated. Repeat screening for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) at least annually. Sudden behavioural changes may indicate a new physical problem (for example with the kidneys, epilepsy or a SEGA). Routine EEG determined by clinical need. Infantile spasms are best treated with vigabatrin and adrenocorticotropic hormone used as a second-line therapy. Other seizure types have no TSC-specific recommendation, though epilepsy in TSC is typically difficult to treat (medically refractory). Repeat MRI of abdomen every one to three years throughout life. Check renal (kidney) function annually. Should angiomyolipoma bleed, this is best treated with embolisation and then corticosteroids. Removal of the kidney (nephrectomy) is strongly to be avoided. An asymptomatic angiomyolipoma that is growing larger than 3 cm is best treated with an mTOR inhibitor drug. Other renal complications spotted by imaging include polycystic kidney disease and renal cell carcinoma. Repeat chest HRCT in adult women every five to 10 years. Evidence of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) indicates more frequent testing. An mTOR inhibitor drug can help, though a lung transplant may be required. A 12-lead ECG should be performed every three to five years. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus was approved in the US for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012. Oral everolimus (rapalog) reduces tumour size, is effective in terms of response to skin lesions and does not increase the risk of adverse events.

Turner Syndrome,,"Turner syndrome (TS), commonly known as 45,X, or 45,X0, is a chromosomal disorder in which cells of females have only one X chromosome instead of two, or are partially missing an X chromosome (sex chromosome monosomy) leading to the complete or partial deletion of the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1, PAR2) in the affected X chromosome. Humans typically have two sex chromosomes, XX for females or XY for males. The chromosomal abnormality is often present in just some cells, in which case it is known as Turner syndrome with mosaicism.","As a chromosomal condition, there is no cure for Turner syndrome. However, much can be done to minimize the symptoms. While most of the physical findings are harmless, significant medical problems can be associated with the syndrome. Most of these significant conditions are treatable with surgery and other therapies including hormonal therapy. Synthetic growth hormones, either alone or with a low dose of androgen, will increase height by several inches and probably final adult height. Growth hormone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Turner syndrome and is covered by many insurance plans. It can make Turner females achieve a more normal height There is evidence that this is effective, even in toddlers. A 2019 systematic review comparing effects of adding oxandrolone to growth hormone treatment to growth hormone alone has found moderate-quality evidence that the addition of oxandrolone leads to an increase in final adult height of girls with Turner syndrome. When the same review assessed the effects of adding Oxandrolone to growth hormone treatment on speech, cognition and psychological status, the results were inconclusive due to very-low quality evidence. Estrogen replacement therapy such as the birth control pill, has been used since the condition was described in 1938 to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens are crucial for maintaining good bone integrity, cardiovascular health and tissue health. Women with Turner syndrome who do not have spontaneous puberty and who are not treated with estrogen are at high risk for osteoporosis and heart conditions. Modern reproductive technologies have also been used to help women with Turner syndrome become pregnant if they desire. For example, a donor egg can be used to create an embryo, which is carried by the Turner syndrome woman.

Type 1 Diabetes,"Frequent urination, Increased thirst, Weight loss","Diabetes mellitus type 1, commonly known as type 1 diabetes (T1D), and formerly known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body's immune system destroys pancreatic cells (beta cells). In healthy persons, beta cells produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone required by the body to store and convert blood sugar into energy.","The mainstay of type 1 diabetes treatment is the regular injection of insulin to manage hyperglycemia. Injections of insulin via subcutaneous injection using either a syringe or an insulin pump are necessary multiple times per day, adjusting dosages to account for food intake, blood glucose levels, and physical activity. The goal of treatment is to maintain blood sugar in a normal range—80–130 mg/dL (4.4–7.2 mmol/L) before a meal; <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) after—as often as possible. To achieve this, people with diabetes often monitor their blood glucose levels at home. Around 83% of type 1 diabetics monitor their blood glucose by capillary blood testing: pricking the finger to draw a drop of blood, and determining blood glucose with a glucose meter. The American Diabetes Association recommends testing blood glucose around 6–10 times per day: before each meal, before exercise, at bedtime, occasionally after a meal, and any time someone feels the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Around 17% of people with type 1 diabetes use a continuous glucose monitor, a device with a sensor under the skin that constantly measures glucose levels and communicates those levels to an external device. Continuous glucose monitoring is associated with better blood sugar control than capillary blood testing alone; however, continuous glucose monitoring tends to be substantially more expensive. Healthcare providers can also monitor someone's hemoglobin A1C levels, which reflect the average blood sugar over the last three months. The American Diabetes Association recommends a goal of keeping hemoglobin A1C levels under 7% for most adults and 7.5% for children. The goal of insulin therapy is to mimic normal pancreatic insulin secretion: low levels of insulin are constantly present to support basic metabolism, plus the two-phase secretion of additional insulin in response to high blood sugar, then an extended phase of continued insulin secretion. This is accomplished by combining different insulin preparations that act with differing speeds and durations. The standard of care for type 1 diabetes is a bolus of rapid-acting insulin 10–15 minutes before each meal or snack, and as-needed to correct hyperglycemia. In addition, constant low levels of insulin are achieved with one or two daily doses of long-acting insulin, or by steady infusion by an insulin pump. The exact dose of insulin appropriate for each injection depends on the content of the meal/snack, and the person's sensitivity to insulin, and is therefore typically calculated by the individual with diabetes or a family member by hand or assistive device (calculator, chart, mobile app, etc.). People who cannot manage these intensive insulin regimens are sometimes prescribed alternate plans relying on mixtures of rapid- or short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin, which are administered at fixed times along with meals of pre-planned times and carbohydrate composition. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence now recommends closed-loop insulin systems as an option for all women with type 1 diabetes who are pregnant or planning pregnancy. A non-insulin medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating type 1 diabetes is the amylin analog pramlintide, which replaces the beta-cell hormone amylin. The addition of pramlintide to mealtime insulin injections reduces the boost in blood sugar after a meal, improving blood sugar control. Occasionally, metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, or SGLT2 inhibitor are prescribed off-label to people with type 1 diabetes. Fewer than 5% of people with type 1 diabetes use these drugs. There is no way to prevent type 1 diabetes; however, the development of diabetes symptoms can be delayed in some people who are at high risk of developing the disease. In 2022, the FDA approved an intravenous injection of teplizumab to delay the progression of type 1 diabetes in those older than eight who have already developed diabetes-related autoantibodies and problems with blood sugar control. In that population, the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody teplizumab can delay the development of type 1 diabetes symptoms by around two years. In addition to anti-CD3 antibodies, several other immunosuppressive agents have been trialled to prevent beta cell destruction. Large trials of cyclosporine treatment suggested that cyclosporine could improve insulin secretion in those recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes; however, people who stopped taking cyclosporine rapidly stopped making insulin, and cyclosporine's kidney toxicity and increased risk of cancer prevented people from using it long-term. Several other immunosuppressive agents – prednisone, azathioprine, anti-thymocyte globulin, mycophenolate, and antibodies against CD20 and IL2 receptor α – have been the subject of research. None has provided lasting protection from the development of type 1 diabetes. There have also been clinical trials attempting to induce immune tolerance by vaccination with insulin, GAD65, and various short peptides targeted by immune cells during type 1 diabetes; none have yet delayed or prevented development of disease. Several trials have attempted dietary interventions with the hope of reducing the autoimmunity that leads to type 1 diabetes. Trials that withheld cow's milk or gave infants formula free of bovine insulin decreased the development of β-cell-targeted antibodies, but did not prevent the development of type 1 diabetes. Similarly, trials that gave high-risk individuals injected insulin, oral insulin, or nicotinamide did not prevent diabetes development. Other strategies under investigation for the prevention of type 1 diabetes include gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and modulation of the gut microbiome. Gene therapy approaches are still in early stages. They aim to alter genetic factors that contribute to beta-cell destruction by editing immune responses. Stem cell therapies are also being researched, with the hope that they can either regenerate insulin-producing beta cells or protect them from immune attack. Trials using stem cells to restore beta cell function or regulate immune responses are ongoing. Modifying the gut microbiota through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or specific diets has also gained attention. Some evidence suggests that the gut microbiome plays a role in immune regulation, and researchers are investigating whether altering the microbiome could reduce the risk of autoimmunity and, subsequently, type 1 diabetes. Tolerogenic therapies, which seek to induce immune tolerance to beta-cell antigens, are another area of interest. Techniques such as using dendritic cells or regulatory T cells engineered to promote tolerance to beta cells are being studied in clinical trials, though these approaches remain experimental. There is also a hypothesis that certain viral infections, particularly enteroviruses, may trigger type 1 diabetes in genetically predisposed individuals. Researchers are investigating whether vaccines targeting these viruses could reduce the risk of developing the disease. Combination immunotherapies are being explored to achieve more durable immune protection by using multiple agents together. For example, anti-CD3 antibodies may be combined with other immunomodulatory agents such as IL-1 blockers or checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, researchers are studying how environmental factors such as infections, diet, and stress may affect immune regulation through epigenetic modifications. The hope is that targeting these epigenetic changes could delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes in high-risk individuals.","['frequent urination', 'increased thirst', 'weight loss']","type 1

there have also been clinical trials attempting to induce immune tolerance by vaccination with insulin, gad65, and various short peptides targeted by immune cells during type 1 diabetes none have yet delayed or prevented development of disease. several trials have attempted dietary interventions with the hope of reducing the autoimmunity that leads to type 1 diabetes. trials that withheld cow s milk or gave infants formula free of bovine insulin decreased the development of -cell-targeted antibodies, but did not prevent the development of type 1 diabetes. similarly, trials that gave high-risk individuals injected insulin, oral insulin, or nicotinamide did not prevent diabetes development. other strategies under investigation for the prevention of type 1 diabetes include gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and modulation of the gut microbiome. gene therapy approaches are still in early stages. they aim to alter genetic factors that contribute to beta-cell destruction by editing immune responses. stem cell therapies are also being researched, with the hope that they can either regenerate insulin-producing beta cells or protect them from immune attack. trials using stem cells to restore beta cell function or regulate immune responses are ongoing. modifying the gut microbiota through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or specific diets has also gained attention. some evidence suggests that the gut microbiome plays a role in immune regulation, and researchers are investigating whether altering the microbiome could reduce the risk of autoimmunity and, subsequently, type 1 diabetes. tolerogenic therapies, which seek to induce immune tolerance to beta-cell antigens, are another area of interest. techniques such as using dendritic cells or regulatory t cells engineered to promote tolerance to beta cells are being studied in clinical trials, though these approaches remain experimental. there is also a hypothesis that certain viral infections, particularly enteroviruses, may trigger type 1 diabetes in genetically predisposed individuals. researchers are investigating whether vaccines targeting these viruses could reduce the risk of developing the disease. combination immunotherapies are being explored to achieve more durable immune protection by using multiple agents together. for example, anti-cd3 antibodies may be combined with other immunomodulatory agents such as il-1 blockers or checkpoint inhibitors. finally, researchers are studying how environmental factors such as infections, diet, and stress may affect immune regulation through epigenetic modifications. the hope is that targeting these epigenetic changes could delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes in high-risk individuals."
Type 2 Diabetes,"increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue","Diabetes mellitus type 2, commonly known as type 2 diabetes (T2D), and formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin. Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue and unexplained weight loss. Other symptoms include increased hunger, having a sensation of pins and needles, and sores (wounds) that heal slowly.","Onset of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise. Intensive lifestyle measures may reduce the risk by over half. The benefit of exercise occurs regardless of the person's initial weight or subsequent weight loss. High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of diabetes by about 28%. Evidence for the benefit of dietary changes alone, however, is limited, with some evidence for a diet high in green leafy vegetables and some for limiting the intake of sugary drinks. There is an association between higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice and diabetes, but no evidence of an association with 100% fruit juice. A 2019 review found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber. A 2017 review found that, long term, lifestyle changes decreased the risk by 28%, while medication does not reduce risk after withdrawal. While low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, correcting the levels by supplementing vitamin D3 does not improve that risk. In those with prediabetes, diet in combination with physical activity delays or reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes, according to a 2017 Cochrane review. In those with prediabetes, metformin may delay or reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to diet and exercise or a placebo intervention, but not compared to intensive diet and exercise, and there was not enough data on outcomes such as mortality and diabetic complications and health-related quality of life, according to a 2019 Cochrane review. In those with prediabetes, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose may delay or reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to placebo, however there was no conclusive evidence that acarbose improved cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events, according to a 2018 Cochrane review. In those with prediabetes, pioglitazone may delay or reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to placebo or no intervention, but no difference was seen compared to metformin, and data were missing on mortality and complications and quality of life, according to a 2020 Cochrane review. In those with prediabetes, there was insufficient data to draw any conclusions on whether SGLT2 inhibitors may delay or reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, according to a 2016 Cochrane review. Management of type 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions, lowering other cardiovascular risk factors, and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range. Self-monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes may be used in combination with education, although the benefit of self-monitoring in those not using multi-dose insulin is questionable. In those who do not want to measure blood levels, measuring urine levels may be done. Managing other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and microalbuminuria, improves a person's life expectancy. Decreasing the systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg is associated with a lower risk of death and better outcomes. Intensive blood pressure management (less than 130/80 mmHg) as opposed to standard blood pressure management (less than 140–160 mmHg systolic to 85–100 mmHg diastolic) results in a slight decrease in stroke risk but no effect on overall risk of death. Intensive blood sugar lowering (HbA1c < 6%) as opposed to standard blood sugar lowering (HbA1c of 7–7.9%) does not appear to change mortality. The goal of treatment is typically an HbA1c of 7 to 8% or a fasting glucose of less than 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL); however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation, taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy. Hypoglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes. Despite guidelines recommending that intensive blood sugar control be based on balancing immediate harms with long-term benefits, many people – for example people with a life expectancy of less than nine years who will not benefit, are over-treated. It is recommended that all people with type 2 diabetes get regular eye examinations. There is moderate evidence suggesting that treating gum disease by scaling and root planing results in an improvement in blood sugar levels for people with diabetes.","['increased thirst', 'frequent

Candidal vulvovaginitis in pregnancy should be treated with intravaginal clotrimazole or nystatin for at least 7 days. All are more or less equally effective. By mouth: ibrexafungerp, fluconazole as a single dose. For severe disease another dose after 3 days may be used. Short-course topical formulations (i.e., single dose and regimens of 1–3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated candidal vulvovaginitis. The topically applied azole drugs are more effective than nystatin. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80–90% of patients who complete therapy. The creams and suppositories in this regimen are oil-based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Treatment for vagina thrush using antifungal medication is ineffective in up to 20% of cases.

Vitamin A Deficiency,"Night blindness, dry eyes, dry or rough skin, poor wound healing, weakened immune system","Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) or hypovitaminosis A is a lack of vitamin A in blood and tissues. It is common in poorer countries, especially among children and women of reproductive age, but is rarely seen in more developed countries. Vitamin A plays a major role in phototransduction, so this deficiency impairs vision, often presenting with nyctalopia (night blindness).","Treatment of VAD can be undertaken with both oral vitamin A and injectable forms, generally as vitamin A palmitate. High dose vitamin A supplementation has been proven to be an effective and cost effective treatment. Current World Health Organization guidance recommends biannual vitamin A supplementation for children aged 6 to 59 months in areas with high levels of retinol deficiency. Children aged 6-12 months should receive a dose of 100,000 IU and children aged 1-5 years should receive a dose of 200,000 IU each time. This significantly reduces the risk of morbidity, especially from severe diarrhea, and reduces mortality from measles and all-cause mortality. Vitamin A supplementation of children under five who are at risk of VAD has been found to reduce all‐cause mortality by 12 to 24%. Side effects of vitamin A supplements are rare. Vitamin A toxicity is a rare concern associated with high levels of vitamin A over prolonged periods of time. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, irritability, blurred vision, and a lack of muscle coordination. However, when administered in the correct dose, vitamin A is generally safe and effective. The World Health Organization also recommends vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy and lactation in areas where VAD is prevalent. Maternal high supplementation benefits both mother and breast-fed infant: high-dose vitamin A supplementation of the lactating mother in the first month postpartum can provide the breast-fed infant with an appropriate amount of vitamin A through breast milk. It also reduces the risk of infection, night blindness, and anemia in the mother. However, vitamin A supplementation in developed countries and high-dose supplementation of pregnant women should be avoided because it can cause miscarriage and birth defects. Although synthetic vitamin A supplementation is a useful and effective treatment for VAD, a 2017 review (updated in 2022) reported that synthetic vitamin A supplementation may not be the best long‐term solution for vitamin A deficiency, but rather food fortification, improved food distribution programs, and crop improvement, such as for fortified rice or vitamin A-rich sweet potato, may be more effective in eradicating vitamin A deficiency. Food fortification is also useful for improving VAD. A variety of oily and dry forms of the retinol esters, retinyl acetates, and retinyl palmitate are available for food fortification of vitamin A. Margarine and oil are the ideal food vehicles for vitamin A fortification. They protect vitamin A from oxidation during storage and prompt absorption of vitamin A. Beta-carotene and retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate are used as a form of vitamin A for vitamin A fortification of fat-based foods. Fortification of sugar with retinyl palmitate as a form of vitamin A has been used extensively throughout Central America. Cereal flours, milk powder, and liquid milk are also used as food vehicles for vitamin A fortification. In addition to adding synthetic vitamin A to foods, researchers have explored fortifying foods such as rice and corn through genetic engineering. Research on rice began in 1982, and the first field trials of golden rice cultivars were conducted in 2004. The result was ""Golden Rice"", a variety of Oryza sativa rice produced through genetic engineering to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of retinol, in the edible parts of rice. In May 2018, regulatory agencies in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand concluded that Golden Rice met food safety standards. On 21 July 2021, the Philippines became the first country to officially issue the biosafety permit for commercially propagating Golden Rice. In 2023, however, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ordered the agriculture department to stop commercial propagation of golden rice in relation to a petition filed by MASIPAG (a group of farmers and scientists), who claimed that golden rice poses risk to the health of consumers and to the environment. Researchers at the U.S. Agricultural Research Service have been able to identify genetic sequences in corn that are associated with higher levels of beta-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A. They found that breeders can cross certain variations of corn to produce a crop with an 18-fold increase in beta-carotene. Dietary diversification can also reduce risk of VAD. Non-animal sources of vitamin A like fruits and vegetables contain pro-vitamin A and account for greater than 80% of intake for most individuals in the developing world. The increase in consumption of vitamin A-rich foods of animal origin such as liver, milk, cheese, or eggs, also has beneficial effects on VAD.","['night blindness', 'dry eyes', 'dry or rough skin',

Von Willebrand Disease,"Easy or excessive bruising, prolonged or excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, frequent nosebleeds, heavy or prolonged menstrual periods, bleeding gums, blood in urine or stool","Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a type of blood-clotting disorder. It is the most common hereditary coagulopathy in humans, affecting 1% of the population. An acquired form of VWD can sometimes result from other medical conditions.","For patients with VWD type 1 and VWD type 2A, desmopressin is available as different preparations, recommended for use in cases of minor trauma, or in preparation for dental or minor surgical procedures. Desmopressin stimulates the release of VWF from the Weibel–Palade bodies of endothelial cells, thereby increasing the levels of VWF (as well as coagulant factor VIII) three- to five-fold. Desmopressin is also available as a preparation for intranasal administration (Stimate) and as a preparation for intravenous administration. Desmopressin is contraindicated in VWD type 2b because of the risk of aggravated thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications. Desmopressin is probably not effective in VWD type 2M and is rarely effective in VWD type 2N. It is totally ineffective in VWD type 3. For women with heavy menstrual bleeding, estrogen-containing oral contraceptive medications are effective in reducing the frequency and duration of the menstrual periods. Estrogen and progesterone compounds available for use in the correction of menorrhagia include ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, drospirenone and cyproterone. Administration of ethinylestradiol diminishes the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary, leading to stabilization of the endometrial surface of the uterus. Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of the natural antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. Its overuse can lead to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia with consequent convulsion. For patients with VWD scheduled for surgery and cases of VWD disease complicated by clinically significant hemorrhage, human-derived medium purity factor VIII concentrates, which also contain von Willebrand factors, are available for prophylaxis and treatment. Humate P, Alphanate, Wilate and Koate HP are commercially available for prophylaxis and treatment of VWD, and have varying levels of factor VIII. Products with higher VWF:RCo/FVIII ratios allow for more frequent dosing of VWF if needed, without the risk of accumulation to supranormal levels of FVIII. Recombinant factor VIII products contain insignificant quantity of VWF, so are not clinically useful as standalone therapy for VWD. Risks of thrombosis, development of alloantibodies, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis must be considered when administering these preparations. Such risks have emerged as the main concerns in factor replacement therapies as infectious risks have diminished. Blood transfusions are given as needed to correct anemia and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia. Infusion of platelet concentrates is recommended for correction of hemorrhage associated with platelet-type VWD. Vonicog alfa is a recombinant von Willebrand factor that was approved for use in the United States in December 2015, and for use in the European Union in August 2018. If baseline factor VIII activity is >40%, rVWF may be administered as a standalone product when immediate response is needed, but if Factor VIII activity is <40% and immediate response is needed, rVWF must be administered in conjunction with FVIII replacement therapy.","['easy or excessive bruising', 'prolonged or excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries', 'frequent nosebleeds', 'heavy or prolonged menstrual periods', 'bleeding gums', 'blood in urine or stool']","von willebrand disease easy or excessive bruising, prolonged or excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, frequent nosebleeds, heavy or prolonged menstrual periods, bleeding gums, blood in urine or stool von willebrand disease (vwd) is a type of blood-clotting disorder. it is the most common hereditary coagulopathy in humans, affecting 1 of the population. an acquired form of vwd can sometimes result from other medical conditions. for patients with vwd type 1 and vwd type 2a, desmopressin is available as different preparations, recommended for use in cases of minor trauma, or in preparation for dental or minor surgical procedures. desmopressin stimulates the release of vwf from the weibel palade bodies of endothelial cells, thereby increasing the levels of vwf (as well as coagulant factor viii) three- to five-fold. desmopressin is also available as a preparation for intranasal administration (stimate) and as a preparation for intravenous administration. desmopressin is contraindicated in vwd type 2b because of the risk of aggravated thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications. desmopressin is probably not effective in vwd type 2m and is rarely effective in vwd type 2n. it is totally ineffective in vwd type 3. for women with heavy menstrual bleeding, estrogen-containing oral contraceptive medications are effective in reducing the frequency and duration of the menstrual periods. estrogen and progesterone compounds available for use in the correction of menorrhagia include ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, drospirenone and cyproterone. administration of ethinylestradiol diminishes the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary, leading to stabilization of the endometrial surface of the uterus. desmopressin is a synthetic analog of the natural antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. its overuse can lead to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia with consequent convulsion. for patients with vwd scheduled for surgery and cases of vwd disease complicated by clinically significant hemorrhage, human-derived medium purity factor viii concentrates, which also contain von willebrand factors, are available for prophylaxis and treatment. humate p, alphanate, wilate and koate hp are commercially available for prophylaxis and treatment of vwd, and have varying levels of factor viii. products with higher vwf rco/fviii ratios allow for more frequent dosing of vwf if needed, without the risk of accumulation to supranormal levels of fviii. recombinant factor viii products contain insignificant quantity of vwf, so are not clinically useful as standalone therapy for vwd. risks of thrombosis, development of alloantibodies, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis must be considered when administering these preparations. such risks have emerged as the main concerns in factor replacement therapies as infectious risks have diminished. blood transfusions are given as needed to correct anemia and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia. infusion of platelet concentrates is recommended for correction of hemorrhage associated with platelet-type vwd. vonicog alfa is a recombinant von willebrand factor that was approved for use in the united states in december 2015, and for use in the european union in august 2018. if baseline factor viii activity is 40 , rvwf may be administered as a standalone product when immediate response is needed, but if factor viii activity is 40 and immediate response is needed, rvwf must be administered in conjunction with fviii replacement therapy."

A person can also wear clothing that covers more skin, such as long sleeves and pants. Mosquito control can be done at the community level and include surveillance programs and control programs including pesticides and reducing mosquito habitats. This includes draining standing water. Surveillance systems in birds is particularly useful. If dead birds are found in a neighborhood, the event should be reported to local authorities.

Developmental and speech therapy can also help children and increase the success of their social interactions. Other treatments are based on a patient's particular symptoms. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual cardiology evaluations for individuals with WS. Other recommended assessments include ophthalmologic evaluations, an examination for inguinal hernia, objective hearing assessment, blood-pressure measurement, developmental and growth evaluation, orthopedic assessments on joints and muscle tone, and ongoing feeding and dietary assessments to manage constipation and urinary problems. Behavioral treatments have been shown to be effective. In regard to social skills, it may be effective to channel their nature by teaching basic skills. Some of these are the appropriate way to approach someone, how and when to socialize in settings such as school or the workplace, and warning of the signs and dangers of exploitation. For phobias, cognitive-behavioral approaches, such as therapy, are the recommended treatments.

Zika,"Mild fever, red rash, joint pain, red eyes, fatigue","Mild fever, red rash, joint pain, red eyes, fatigue. Zika virus infection is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito.","The virus is spread by mosquitoes, making mosquito avoidance an important element of disease control. The CDC recommends that individuals: Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants treated with permethrin. Use an insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), or ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535) Always follow product directions and reapply as directed If you are also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first, let it dry, then apply insect repellent Follow package directions when applying repellent to children. Avoid applying repellent to their hands, eyes, or mouth Stay and sleep in screened-in or air-conditioned rooms Use a bed net if the area where you are sleeping is exposed to the outdoors Cover cribs, strollers, and carriers with mosquito netting for babies under 2 months old. The CDC also recommends strategies for controlling mosquitoes, such as eliminating standing water, repairing septic tanks, and using screens on doors and windows. Spraying insecticide is used to kill flying mosquitoes and larvicide can be used in water containers. Because Zika virus can be sexually transmitted, men who have gone to an area where Zika fever is occurring should be counseled to either abstain from sex or use condoms for 6 months after travel if their partner is pregnant or could potentially become pregnant. Breastfeeding is still recommended by the WHO, even by women who have had Zika fever. There have been no recorded cases of Zika transmission to infants through breastfeeding, though the replicative virus has been detected in breast milk. When returning from travel, with or without symptoms, it is suggested that prevention of mosquito bites continue for 3 weeks to reduce the risk of virus transmission to uninfected mosquitoes. There is currently no specific treatment for Zika virus infection. Care is supportive with the treatment of pain, fever, and itching. Some authorities have recommended against using aspirin and other NSAIDs as these have been associated with hemorrhagic syndrome when used for other flaviviruses. Additionally, aspirin use is generally avoided in children when possible due to the risk of Reye syndrome. Zika virus was poorly studied until the major outbreak in 2015, and no specific antiviral treatments are available as yet. Advice to pregnant women is to avoid any risk of infection so far as possible, as once infected, there is little that can be done beyond supportive treatment. Recent studies have explored the use of the Zika virus (ZIKV) as a potential treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain cancer. GBM has a median survival rate of about 15 months due to limited treatment options and high tumor recurrence rates. Oncolytic virotherapy, which uses specific viruses to target and destroy cancer cells, has shown promise as an alternative treatment for GBM. One study investigated the oncolytic potential of live-attenuated vaccine strains of Zika virus (ZIKV-LAV) against human GBM cells in vitro. The study found that ZIKV-LAV selectively infected and killed GBM cells without affecting terminally differentiated neurons or primary endothelial cells. ZIKV-LAV induced cell death through apoptosis and pyroptosis, two forms of programmed cell death. This research highlights the potential of ZIKV-LAV as a treatment for GBM through oncolytic virotherapy. However, further clinical trials and research are necessary to assess its efficacy in human patients.","['mild fever', 'red rash', 'joint pain', 'red eyes', 'fatigue']","zika mild fever, red rash, joint pain, red eyes, fatigue mild fever, red rash, joint pain, red eyes, fatigue. zika virus infection is transmitted by the aedes mosquito. the virus is spread by mosquitoes, making mosquito avoidance an important element of disease control. the cdc recommends that individuals cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants treated with permethrin. use an insect repellent containing deet, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (ole), or ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (ir3535) always follow product directions and reapply as directed if you are also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first, let it dry, then apply insect repellent follow package directions when applying repellent to children. avoid applying repellent to their hands, eyes, or mouth stay and sleep in screened-in or air-conditioned rooms use a bed net if the area where you are sleeping is exposed to the outdoors cover cribs, strollers, and carriers with mosquito netting for babies under 2 months old. the cdc also recommends strategies for controlling mosquitoes, such as eliminating standing water, repairing septic tanks, and using screens on doors and windows. spraying insecticide is used to kill flying mosquitoes and larvicide can be used in water containers. because zika virus can be sexually transmitted, men who have gone to an area where zika fever is occurring should be counseled to either abstain from sex or use condoms for 6 months after travel if their partner is pregnant or could potentially become pregnant. breastfeeding is still recommended by the who, even by women who have had zika fever. there have been no recorded cases of zika transmission to infants through breastfeeding, though the replicative virus has been detected in breast milk. when returning from travel, with or without symptoms, it is suggested that prevention of mosquito bites continue for 3 weeks to reduce the risk of virus transmission to uninfected mosquitoes. there is currently no specific treatment for zika virus infection. care is supportive with the treatment of pain, fever, and itching. some authorities have recommended against using aspirin and other nsaids as these have been associated with hemorrhagic syndrome when used for other flaviviruses. additionally, aspirin use is generally avoided in children when possible due to the risk of reye syndrome. zika virus was poorly studied until the major outbreak in 2015, and no specific antiviral treatments are available as yet. advice to pregnant women is to avoid any risk of infection so far as possible, as once infected, there is little that can be done beyond supportive treatment. recent studies have explored the use of the zika virus (zikv) as a potential treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (gbm), a highly aggressive brain cancer. gbm has a median survival rate of about 15 months due to limited treatment options and high tumor recurrence rates. oncolytic virotherapy, which uses specific viruses to target and destroy cancer cells, has shown promise as an alternative treatment for gbm. one study investigated the oncolytic potential of live-attenuated vaccine strains of zika virus (zikv-lav) against human gbm cells in vitro. the study found that zikv-lav selectively infected and killed gbm cells without affecting terminally differentiated neurons or primary endothelial cells. zikv-lav induced cell death through apoptosis and pyroptosis, two forms of programmed cell death. this research highlights the potential of zikv-lav as a treatment for gbm through oncolytic virotherapy. however, further clinical trials and research are necessary to assess its efficacy in human patients."
